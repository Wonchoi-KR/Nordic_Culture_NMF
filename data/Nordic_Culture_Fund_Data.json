The reason behind the investigation was the general opinion that language comprehension has deteriorated over the past 30 years, when a similar investigation was carried out.\n\u00a0\nDuring this period of time, the Nordic countries have undergone great changes. Many non-Scandinavian immigrants have now been added to the population, the role of the media has changed, the Nordic countries are now closer connected to the rest of Europe, and the school system has changed considerably. In many of these processes, English, as well as other non-Scandinavian languages have increased their importance.\n\u00a0\nApproximately 1800 youths from all the Nordic countries have participated in the investigation, by having their comprehension of Danish, Swedish, and Norwegian tested. As comparison, the young people\u2019s comprehension of English was also investigated, as well as some of the parents\u2019 comprehension of neighbouring languages. In connection with the investigation, the young people\u2019s Nordic contact patterns and attitudes were also studied. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe investigation was carried out in 14 Nordic locations, in the five capitals, and in an additional\u00a0nine locations; from Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 in Finland to Nuuk on Greenland. The investigation was carried out by the department of Nordic languages at The University of Lund, 2003 \u2013 2004.\n\u00a0\nThe results of this new investigation are presented in the report \"H\u00e5ller spr\u00e5ket ihop Norden?\" (Does Languages Unite the Nordic Countries?). The report reveals quite substantial changes in the comprehension of Danish, Swedish, and Norwegian since the 1970ies.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n"

In a time of upheaval, when nations close in upon themselves, art can act as a focal point that opens up and creates connections.\nWe have three overall objectives:\n\t\tWe will promote the production, innovation and communication of arts and culture in the Nordic region and globally.\n\t\tWe will promote artistic and cultural networks at all levels within the Nordic cultural co-operation.\n\t\tWe will develop and communicate knowledge of arts and cultural life in order to stimulate the development of cultural policy in the Nordic region.\nPART OF THE NORDIC CO-OPERATION\nThe Nordic Culture Fund contributes to positive artistic and cultural development in the Nordic Region by promoting co-operation between Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, the Faroe Islands, Greenland and \u00c5land.\u00a0We do this by gathering knowledge and information, building networks and providing financial support.\n\u00a0\nThe Fund was established in 1966, based on an agreement between all of the Nordic countries.\u00a0The Nordic Culture Fund is an independent legal entity associated with the Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers.\nPrinciples for grant making\nThe Nordic Culture Fund has been working in the area of cultural co-operation since 1966, focusing on the allocation of grants as the main task. Last three years, we have developed a clear and more specified approach for the grants.\n\u00a0\nWe see that cultural life changes continuously and, therefore, there is not two similar application. To meet the different needs of applicants, we have developed more customised grants.\n\u00a0\nCultural life is in continuous movement, and no two applicants are identical. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve developed Opstart, Handmade and Puls. In this way, we can celebrate and support diversity and seize trends while they are still new.\n\u00a0\nThe following principles characterise the grants by the Nordic Culture Fund:\n\n\nDEVELOPMENT OF NORDIC RELEVANCE, QUALITY AND CO-OPERATION\nEvery granted initiative and project need to support at least one of the Fund's criteria:\n\u00a0\nNordic relevance\nThe projects and initiatives are, either partly or fully, created and implemented by stakeholders with a Nordic base. The projects extend beyond a national perspective and promote openness and tolerance.\n\u00a0\nQuality of the projects and how they develop art and culture in the Nordic region\nThe projects and initiatives need to reflect their Nordic relevance and mutual significance in local, regional, national and\/or global contexts. The projects need to have\u00a0long-term artistic or cultural ambitions and visions.\n\u00a0\nQuality and substance of the co-operation\nThere have to be a commitment of participating partners, the target groups, and the extent to which the project is embedded in relevant environments.\n\n\n\nRISK-TAKING\nThe Nordic Culture Fund supports unique projects where the Fund's support has a distinct relevance.\n\u00a0\nThe Fund supports risk-taking and\u00a0through its assesment and grants allocation\u00a0functions as a quality stamp for projects and initiatives.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nCO-FUNDING\nThe Project Funding and the thematic programs must have an appropriate level of co-funding. This is a central part of anchoring the projects to its co-operative partners.\n\u00a0\nThe Fund can support the development of smaller project ideas and the start-up phase of Nordic collaborations without requirements of co-funding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here you can read more about the fund's work with Globus. In 2020-2021, the new programme will be tested on few selected pilot projects. During autumn 2020 it is also possible to apply for Globus Opstart which supports the development of ideas and collaboration in global contexts.\nWith Globus, we are writing a new chapter in our history\nWe intend to meet artists where they are, support them with trust and with willingness to take risks, thereby making room for global perspectives on our part of the world.\u2028\nThe programme is a response to the ever-growing need for new ways to act informally and progressively across borders. That is why the fund is launching the new global initiative, which will expand perspectives on Nordic art and culture.\nA new way of looking at funding\nUnlike the fund's other programmes such as Puls, Handmade and Opstart, there is no criterion for regional co-operation in the programme. On the contrary, we aim to support projects that cannot be implemented in the Nordic region alone.\n\u00a0\nIn this way, we intend to stimulate projects that use art and creativity as a catalyst for conversations with the younger generations and the new citizens of the Nordic countries; projects that will help to develop the public space, creating new communities that can rise above the languages and differences that separate us, and causing new things to arise in our common democracy\n\nGLOBAL VERSUS INTERNATIONAL\nWe view the global as borderless - the world as a united whole.\nThe international is defined by the borders between nations, so its scale is narrower than the global, as is implied by the word itself: inter-national.\n\u2028Global\u00a0We will create global relevance for the Nordic co-operation.\nInternational\u00a0We will participate in international networks.\nPilot projects\nIn its first year, the new programme will be tested on few selected pilot projects. Here we will obtain concrete project experience which can lead to a more open support programme with diverse approaches.\n\u00a0\nAll of our pilot projects aim to embrace and engage with the younger generation of artists, institutions and cultural performers in order to clarify their voices. In these pilot projects, we will work with a number of different partners both inside and outside the Nordic region, which will help to secure a broader financing basis and a long-term focus.\n\u00a0\nTogether with talent organisations, we will investigate what is required for young, talented artists to realise their dream projects, on the basis of global collaboration.\n\u00a0\nWe will strengthen the conversation about the Nordic region as a centre of arts and culture, and create a new international network for critical thinking that will support Nordic artists and cultural practitioners on the global stage.\n\u00a0\nWe will conduct democratic projects at street level and explore how artistic mobility can be facilitated within the Nordic region, as a developed region, as well as in other places in the world that do not have the same preconditions. Here, together with UNESCO and others, we will strengthen the dialogue on the diversity of cultural expressions and the diverse role of cultural policy in the world. We see this as central to paving the way for global cultural co-operation both within and outside the Nordic region.\n\n\nGlobus Opstart\nWith Globus Opstart, the Nordic Culture Fund is taking the first exploratory step towards establishing Globus as a support program during 2021. We want to investigate how artists and cultural practitioners' global collaboration takes place and can be developed between practitioners from the Nordic countries and the rest of the world.\n\u00a0\nYOUR GLOBUS OPSTART PROJECT\nWe encourage applicants to think new in terms of idea, theme as well as networking and collaboration. And we encourage applicants with the projects to investigate and establish clear structures and project organizations, which can lead to the formation of networks with the global projects, characterized by deep relations and duration.\n\u00a0\nWith Globus Opstart, we also encourage applicants to develop partnerships with \u201cglobal signs\u201d, and we welcome projects that work with both the global south and the global north. The projects can both include physical meeting or be developed using digital platforms and tools.\u2028\nThe projects must be clearly linked to artistic and\/or cultural environments. The Nordic Culture Fund does not fund projects that focus primarily on, for example, sporting events, business development, technological development and innovation, the social area, journalism or social science.\n\n\nWhen assessing applications:\n\t\tSupport from the fund is dependent on binding participation and contributions from artists and cultural practitioners working outside the Nordic region. The project must have a Nordic anchoring but must not be able to be developed in the Nordic region alone.\u2028\n\t\tWe look at how the project thinks new in terms of idea, theme and in relation to the establishment of networks and collaboration.\n\u00a0\nAs this is a precursor to the development of Globus as a support program, the fund will also assess how the project relates to other Globus Opstart projects.\n\n\n\nThe practical\n\t\tThe processing time for Globus Opstart is 20 working days, and the project must not be commenced before you receive a response to your application. You may therefore only select dates that are at least 20 business days after today\u2019s date. Your Globus Opstart project must be completed within one year of the start date.\n\t\tYou can apply for up to DKK 50,000, and the fee for the project can be a maximum of 1\/3 of the project's total expenses.\n\t\tThere is no requirement for co-financing, but there must be a clear purpose for the project's use of support. The budget in the application must be detailed and, for example, specify travel, the travelers, visa and what materials are needed.\n\t\tThe cooperation between the participating actors must be stated in the project budget.\n\t\tAs Globus Opstart is part of the development of the fund\u2019s global program, it is important that the applicant shares knowledge and learning with the fund during the course of the project.\n\t\tThe fund expects to distribute support to approx. 15-25 Globus Opstart projects in 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The new collaboration takes its starting point in a fine double meaning in the concept of SK\u00c4L. It is a place where the thread and the purification in a vein cross each other.

Funding can also be awarded to projects that build upon previous networking or a previously completed project, provided they involve clear development and innovation of the existing projects, and the Fund\u2019s support can be seen to have clear relevance.\nCultural players, artists, public and private organisations, associations, etc., regardless of nationality, can apply for Project Funding.\nYou can apply for a maximum amount of DKK 500,000, but it is a good idea to obtain an idea of the typical size of the Nordic Culture Fund\u2019s grants before applying. The project must have at least 50% co-financing.\nAn open and inquisitive approach\nWe work with an open and inquisitive approach to the Nordic, and are interested in everything that is under development. Applicants are therefore invited to share with the Fund their perspectives and approaches to the meaning of the Nordic, and to describe how the project in question can contribute to creating meaningful connections and links in the Nordic Region.\nNotice Project Funding does not provide support for:\n\t\tProjects that do not have a clear link to the artistic\/cultural field, such as sports events.\n\t\tIndividual projects, working scholarships, education and study visits.\n\t\tThe participation of individuals or groups in events. Only the planners\/organisers of such events may seek support for this.\n\t\tTours and travelling exhibitions, unless these are part of another substantial Nordic co-operation.\n\t\tOperating costs, the basic financing of organisations, and the construction and procurement of technical equipment for operational use.\n\t\tPublishing and production, if this is the primary purpose of the project, e.g. music releases, film and TV production, video game production, web solutions, book publishing and translation\nAssesment criteria\nApplications are assessed under three main criteria, taking into account the project\u2019s own context:\nArtistic\/cultural content and ambitions\nThe Fund assesses the artistic and\/or cultural ambitions of the project and its content, methods and implementation plan. Emphasis is placed on innovation and development, including in relation to any previous projects.\nNordic relevance and collaboration in the project\nThe Fund assesses the anchoring of the project in relevant actors across the Nordic Region and the Nordic cooperation in the project: the project\u2019s significance for the partners involved, and their commitment to it.\nThe Fund assesses the project\u2019s exploration of various aspects of the Nordic and its impact on the development of the arts and cultural life within the scope of the project. The Nordic dimension must have greater importance in the project than just cooperation between two Nordic countries: the project must as a minimum have a broader Nordic content or target audience.\nRelevant and realistic project economy\nThe Fund assesses the extent to which the budget is realistic and well worked out in relation to the content of the project, and the extent to which the collaborative and Nordic ambitions are reflected in the budget. It is a requirement that at least 50% of the budget must come from sources other than the Fund. In total, the project\u2019s income may consist of a maximum of 85% funding from the official Nordic co-operation (e.g. the Nordic Culture Fund and Nordic Culture Point).\n\n\nThe application is received by advisers in the Fund\u2019s secretary, who ensure the application is in accordance with the program\u2019s criteria. Next, the advisers seek a professional statement of experts in the field who work externally to the Fund, before recommending the application for a final decision. It is the Director of the Fund, by authority of the Board of the Fund, who makes the final decision based on the expert\u2019s statement and the secretary\u2019s recommendation.\n\nConditions\nBudget\n\t\tA project budget must be uploaded.\n\t\tYou are welcome to make use of the Fund\u2019s template to create an informative budget.\n\t\tIncome in the budget may consist of both investment from the partners, confirmed or requested external funding, and possibly a calculated value of the services of partners and others, such as volunteer time or other resources made available to the project.\n\t\tThe currency of the uploaded budget is optional, but the budget must be structured in headings in Danish krone (DKK) in the application form as the Nordic Culture Fund operates in DKK.\nProject period\n\t\tThe project period may run for a maximum period of the year in which the grant is provided and the two subsequent calendar years. Please contact the secretariat if a granted project cannot be finalized within the planned time frame.\n\t\tThe main activities of the project must not commence until the Fund has made its decision and you have received a response.\nApplications\n\t\tIf an application is rejected, the applicant may apply once more for the same project.\n\t\tThe Fund accepts only electronic applications, which may be submitted via the Fund\u2019s applications portal. Applications submitted by post or e-mail will not be considered.\nPublicity\n\t\tThe Fund\u2019s grants are published on our website and in our annual report.\n\t\tAccording to the Nordic Culture Fund\u2019s rules on public access to information, a list of applications is in the public domain, but the applications are not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The reason behind the investigation was the general opinion that language comprehension has deteriorated over the past 30 years, when a similar investigation was carried out.\n\u00a0\nDuring this period of time, the Nordic countries have undergone great changes. Many non-Scandinavian immigrants have now been added to the population, the role of the media has changed, the Nordic countries are now closer connected to the rest of Europe, and the school system has changed considerably. In many of these processes, English, as well as other non-Scandinavian languages have increased their importance.\n\u00a0\nApproximately 1800 youths from all the Nordic countries have participated in the investigation, by having their comprehension of Danish, Swedish, and Norwegian tested.

DKK 25,000. There is no requirement for co-financing of Opstart.\n\u00a0\nPlease note! Opstart funding is typically applied to cover travel and subsistence expenses in connection with meetings held in the Nordic countries.

The Fund works on the basis of a separate communication strategy, which will continue to reinforce the cross-cutting efforts of the strategy in the coming period through the development of the Fund\u2019s brand identity, external communication and knowledge work. Similarly, the communication must support the Fund\u2019s proactive approach to network creation and help to ensure that the networks are used to create further reach and resonance for the Fund\u2019s efforts.  \n \nAn interest analysis carried out in May 2018 and 2021 shows that increased communication efforts on different platforms and through various initiatives (website, newsletter, Facebook, project ambassadors, etc.) has led to an increased awareness of the Fund and contributed to the Fund continuing to be seen as a relevant actor in cultural life and cultural policy contexts. The survey also showed that the Fund has succeeded in streamlining its communication with applicants and facilitating the digital project journey from application to project completion. However, the Fund will continue to work on developing its applicant-oriented communication on the website and in its criteria and application forms, in order to create more relevant awareness of the Fund\u2019s support work, including among new applicants. \n \nAs the Fund\u2019s cultural policy profile and role in several networks becomes clearer, new needs have also arisen in the day-to-day communication work. Communication is to a greater extent taking place in the various dialogues, projects and physical and digital networks of which the Fund is a part, as well as in the many dialogues and networking processes where the Fund\u2019s brand and legitimacy are created, reinforced and brought into play. It is therefore important that the Fund continues to actively reflect and adapt its communication to current trends, and thinks even more strategically about stakeholders and their needs when planning communication efforts and new initiatives.  \n \nThe involvement and engagement of stakeholders is further challenged in a knowledge and network society, where communication and dialogues are spread across different digital platforms and daily communication choices have become more selective and reflexive. The Fund will therefore more actively engage stakeholders and develop methods that can help to strengthen the Fund\u2019s communication and knowledge work. \n \nIn line with the Fund\u2019s overall goals, we see it as essential to engage in new contexts and networks in order to raise awareness and become a more relevant actor in connection with cultural life and cultural policy.  \nIn this area, the Fund will continue to be a sought-after actor and keynote speaker, working continuously on the dissemination perspective through project ambassadors and national arts and cultural institutions. \nTHE FUND\u2019S ADMINISTRATION \n \n \nThe board, secretariat and experts of the Nordic Culture Fund are the three central parts of the organisation, and jointly undertake knowledge-based, high-quality work with a high degree of legitimacy. The Fund works continuously to develop roles, missions and forms of work between the three parts.  \n \nThe Fund\u2019s supreme authority is its board. The 13 members of the board are appointed by the Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers for two-year terms, which distinguishes the board\u2019s composition from all other co-operation bodies and institutions within the official Nordic co-operation, as the board includes both politicians and civil servants.  \n \nThe Fund\u2019s experts assess the quality of applications, and must have a high level of professional legitimacy. Experts are appointed for three years at a time, and the number of experts may vary. The composition of the expert group is continuously assessed in relation to the applications received and the needs and new trends in the arts and cultural life. The Fund seeks nominations for the experts from the national cultural support authorities.  \n \nThe secretariat undertakes the day-to-day administration of the Fund from its office in Copenhagen, and usually represents the Fund externally. The secretariat currently has seven staff members and is headed by a director, who is appointed by the Fund\u2019s board.  \n \nThe Nordic Culture Fund and the Nordic Council of Ministers have a co-operative administration agreement which states that the Fund will be provided with administrative services in the areas of personnel administration, financial and accounting administration, IT and telephony, services and other administration by the secretariat. According to a status agreement, the Fund\u2019s employees are subject to the same employment conditions as those that apply to the secretariat of the Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers, and the period of employment is limited to a maximum of eight years.  \n \nAs part of the process of developing its operational capacity, the Fund has implemented a development project that has optimised its internal workflows, IT system and digital communication. In the first period of the strategy, this has already led to noticeable efficiency improvements in the Fund\u2019s IT and administration systems. \n  \nIn the years 2021-2024, the Fund is facing budget cuts agreed upon by the ministers for Nordic co-operation. The Fund is therefore working strategically to adjust its budget, without compromising on the quality of its administration, support provision and strategic initiatives. This involves, inter alia, a review and revision of the Fund\u2019s administration agreement, which is intended to lead to a correct relationship between the actual support received and the payments made. In its development work, the Fund will furthermore actively seek out and make itself available to partnerships in which external funding or resources may be provided, linked to specific development projects or collaborations. In this way, linked to the Fund\u2019s development work or support provision, more resources can be made available for the work of the Fund.  \n \nThe Fund aims to be an attractive employer, with employees of high competence and performance. This is a prerequisite for working on the overall objectives of the Fund and on cross-cutting strategic initiatives. The staff of the secretariat must therefore be given good opportunities to maintain and develop their skills and knowledge within the framework of their employment positions and roles.  \n \nThe activities and administration of the Nordic Culture Fund are monitored and audited by the Danish National Audit Office, which provides its auditor\u2019s assessment and opinion annually to the Nordic Council and its control committee.

The project\u2019s knowledge production and cultural-political discussion on performance is created by virtue of a mirroring with the nurse\u2019s work and takes place in collaboration with the nursing programme at UCN in North Jutland (DK), as well as the performance venues MDT in Stockholm (SE) and MadHouse in Helsinki (FI).\nThe applicant wrote about the project:\nThe project is of high artistic quality and Nordic relevance. The link between nursing and performance art is interesting and innovative while contributing with two different perspectives on the tactile, which is a common denominator for the disciplines.\nMuseum of Nordic Digital Art \u2013 MoNDA\nMoNDA is aiming at being the first artist-run museum for Nordic Digital Art. The project focuses on Nordic as well as international art developed with new technologies such as visual art on blockchains (the so-called non-fungible tokens).\n\nThe applicant wrote about the project:\nWith MoNDA we want to lift an area that art museums do not focus on at the moment. We see a great mass of talent among Nordic contemporary artists, which we want to highlight, strengthen and communicate, and to bring to the art community and the public something that does not exist elsewhere and that is not yet provided by any state or private institutions in the cultural life.\nComment from The Fund:\nMoNDA is a vanguard project that supports and strengthens the development of new currents in contemporary art in the Nordic countries.\nTOWARDS ECOLOGIES\nAn association of artistic and cultural institutions, who wish to accelerate action towards more sustainable practices in the Nordic artistic sector through a series of events.\n"

TOWARDS ECOLOGIES consists of a physical gathering, a public event and an online podcast series to generate shared values, speculative narratives and regenerative initiatives across the whole Nordic creative system.\nComment from The Fund:\nThe project provides an important basis for cultural institutions in the Nordic region to better incorporate sustainable practices in the sector. In addition, the collaboration consists of a wide range of relevant actors, spanning both the Nordic region and the artistic and cultural field.\nActs of Art(e)Facts\nSwedish, Moroccan and British project that will explore how textile patterns originally associated with Islam found their way into the Viking textile tradition\nAbout the project:\nA project wishing to present a research-based bilingual craft film in English\/Arabic for global dissemination at an international archaeological conference in Hungary. The project has demonstrated through research that Islamic craft traditions travelled from the Middle East to Northern Europe in the Viking Age, and had a major impact on Viking textile traditions. The vision of the project is to re-globalise craft symbols that have mistakenly come to legitimise Nordic national romanticism and xenophobic Viking myths.\nRelevance for Globus Opstart:\nThe project manages to reach back into history and use the textile art practices of the past to shed light on the subject of Islamophobia, which is highly relevant and topical in the Nordic countries today. The project also succeeds in creating a clear link between the theory of sociology, history and archaeology with a concrete artistic craft.\nTNO\nWhat does the world\u2019s smallest theatre puppet look like?

The aim is to ensure the development of a field that started in the late 1990s in the Nordic countries as a reaction to the archives\u2019 lack of focus on users. The webinar will help to secure the development of archival dissemination by presenting good examples and methodological developments in the Nordic archives.\nComment from the Fund:\nThe project has a high degree of Nordic relevance as it wants to create a network and a professional community between Nordic archive disseminators. In addition, the project undertakes the important task of communicating knowledge from Nordic archives to ordinary citizens.\n\n\n\nARTIVAL\nA Nordic art festival that aims to create sustainable development in the art world with a special attention to the SDGs and conditions for multilingual and multiethnic artists.\nThe applicant wrote about the project:\nARTIVAL is a Nordic art biennial (Visual, Performance and Literature) that directly addresses sustainable development on the Nordic art scenes. The festival will showcase artists of all nationalities and intersectionalities, with a focus on multilingual and multiethnic artists.\nComment from The Fund:\nARTIVAL is a broad Nordic cooperation between Denmark, Iceland, Sweden, Norway and Finland, which gives the project a high Nordic relevance. At the same time, the project also looks beyond the Nordic latitudes by focusing on multiethnic and multicultural artists. In addition, the project has a long-term goal and plan for ARTIVALS development.\nMapenzi \nA project exploring mental illness through a theater performance in a global context.\nAbout the project:\nThe project investigates the term \u201cMapenzi\u201d which is used to describe vagabonds and mentally ill persons in Zimbabwe. The project is an innovative performance investigation that will borrow from two cultures, the Zimbabwean healing ritual and the traditional theatrical performance aesthetic of Denmark.\nRelevance for Globus Opstart:\nThe global collaboration focuses on discrimination and stigmas towards mental illness as a global phenomenon, that can create severe consequences such as social exclusion and inequitable treatment towards people with experience of mental health conditions.\n"

        "texts":"\n \n \nWhat do we see?  \nThe role of the Nordic Culture Fund in relation to network formation is becoming increasingly clear. This takes place both through the Fund\u2019s financial support, which always in itself incorporates an element of networking, and by virtue of the unique role of the Fund as a proactive driver of and participant in networks. The value of networks is considerable. Relations here are growing exponentially, and strong networks create the possibility of relating to other networks in other contexts \u2013 including globally.  \n \nIn recent years the Fund has accumulated valuable experience in this area, and we have encountered a wish for this experience to be brought into play in more areas. There is also a demand for a player that can bring together the national artistic and cultural institutions across the Nordic Region and ensure that they meet and exchange knowledge and experience. This applies inter alia to national public institutions and philanthropic funds who do not have the networks or sufficient knowledge to lift their programmes and the projects they support to a Nordic and international level. Strengthening these networks increases the mutual relevance and impact of everyone\u2019s efforts and work. \n \nInitiatives  \nIn accordance with its overall objectives, the Nordic Culture Fund must participate in and facilitate professional networks. We must utilise the unique knowledge and experience that we thereby acquire to strengthen the further anchoring of the networks in art and culture. The cross-cutting strategic initiative implies that:  \nWe will play a clearer co-ordinating and unifying role for relevant national arts and cultural institutions in the Nordic Region.  \nWe will co-operate with private and philanthropic arts and culture foundations in the Nordic Region to help them bring their programmes into a Nordic and international context to a greater degree \u2013 and in doing so, help to create broader funding for Nordic cultural co-operation.  \nWe will establish and support frameworks for strong, long-term networks, thereby enabling actors to promote the quality and sustainability of their own efforts.   \t \nSTRENGTHENED KNOWLEDGE WORK AND NEW CONTEXTS FOR CULTURAL POLICY DEVELOPMENT \n \n \nWhat do we see?  \nThe role of art and culture has changed in the welfare society, and there are discussions in many contexts concerning how this role may be viewed in a modern welfare society. Despite the historically strong commitment to culture and the arts in the Nordic countries, cultural policy, as an autonomous area, is currently weakened. The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated a development that has been underway for some time: cultural consumption has been moving away from the traditional cultural institutions to the digital cultural platforms. At the same time, the global economic crisis has had a devastating impact on the arts and culture sector, making us aware of how integral it is to society. Moreover, artistic identity is in rapid development, pushing the boundaries of who can be considered artists and cultural practitioners. The arts and culture may be seen as a force in their own right, but they are also crucial to our well-being and our ability to create sustainable societies, and in developing the relationship between centre and periphery.  \n \nThe trend points to an increased need for knowledge, discussion and debate in the Nordic Region, and to an increased need to create new contexts for cultural policy development. The Fund\u2019s strategic efforts as an active producer of knowledge have allowed it to create new contexts for the development of cultural policy at Nordic level. In its organisation, the Nordic Culture Fund is anchored in politics and in the implementation of this, which makes the Fund a unique body in the context of Nordic co-operation and cultural policy. The Fund has thus stimulated the development of cultural policy discussions at regional, national and Nordic level. We have also entered into partnerships that have strengthened the Fund\u2019s position as a proactive player, both working actively with cultural and arts institutions and stimulating policy development in specific areas. In this work, we have recognised the need to understand national administrative initiatives, support schemes and cross-border cultural policy priorities. This knowledge has been the prerequisite for raising cultural policy into the international context, of which the Nordic countries are a part. \n \nThe Fund can see that much knowledge is still being lost across borders (national, sectoral, fields of practice), and that there is a need for developed knowledge production and navigation between diverse actors across borders in the Nordic Region. We see that many more actors would be able to come together and help to proactively stimulate the development of cultural policy by using resources to gather knowledge and create arenas for conversations at regional, national and Nordic level. There is a need for knowledge-driven idea development and for more people to take part in Nordic cultural co-operation. More people must be involved in asking questions and coming up with new answers, so that we can maintain the transnational nature of art and culture in terms of expression, collaboration, accessibility and involvement. \n \n \nInitiatives \nAs a cross-cutting strategic initiative, we will take an active role as a facilitator of knowledge production and policy development by engaging in partnerships with actors and organisations who can help to research, collect and debate knowledge about the field of arts and culture. With other organisations, we will create new contexts for cultural policy discussions and knowledge-sharing, and together with others we will anchor our initiatives at either national or Nordic level. This cross-cutting initiative means that during the period:  \n \nWe will publish an anthology that discusses art, culture, democracy and society, and establish discussion forums and meetings on the basis of this anthology. \nWe will facilitate and formalise the organisation of a Nordic partnership project. In this way, we will help to clarify the value and role of art and culture in society, create new contexts for cultural policy in the Nordic Region and support sustainable Nordic and global partnerships and networks for art and culture. \nWe will engage in strategic collaborations that have the potential to be policy-developing in the Nordic Region and beyond \u2013 for example in talent development, sustainable development of cultural institutions, and the interface of the arts with health, professional rights, etc.  \nWe will strengthen our co-operation with national authorities for cultural support, and create better opportunities for Nordic cultural co-operation to be seen as an integral part of international cultural co-operation.  \n  \t "

In the following you can read more about how the Fund assesses applications.\n\nNordic Substance\nThe Fund always evaluates the substance and breadth of the Nordic co-operation in a project. This involves an evaluation of the participants and partners.\nProjects must involve at least three Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, the Faroe Islands, Greenland and \u00c5land). In addition to the three Nordic countries, the project may include co-operation with partners in countries outside of the Nordic Region. The project must also promote co-operation and exchange. Please note:\n\u2022 The Fund does not provide grants for individuals or groups to participate in events. Only the event organiser may seek funding for this purpose.\n\u2022 The Fund only supports tours that have the primary purpose of promoting Nordic co-operation.\nObjectives and quality\nThe Fund evaluates the quality of projects on the basis of their originality, artistic or cultural objectives, content, viability and methods. Please note:\n\u2022 We do not fund the production and distribution of products. This applies to music, film and television, computer games, books and translations.\n\u2022 We do not support projects outside of the arts and culture, e.g. sporting events.\n\u2022 We do not fund study visits or school trips. \nSupport\nThe Fund assesses whether the project enjoys appropriate support in the Nordic countries, for example by gauging the level of commitment of the partners and evaluating the project\u2019s overall funding.\nPlease note:\n\u2022     Projects must have an appropriate level of co-funding \u2013 this is a key criterion in our assessment of the support for a project. The higher the amount applied for, the more self-financing and funding from other sources the Fund expects. In practice, this means that only 50% of the total funding for a project may be from the Culture Fund, and maximum 85% from the various Nordic funding bodies.\nImpact\nThe Fund assesses the project\u2019s impact on and importance for the development of a dynamic artistic and cultural scene in the Nordic Region.\nRecurring projects\nLong-term or recurring projects are evaluated from a development perspective. This means that we emphasise the project\u2019s originality or innovative nature, in both form and content, as well in terms of communication and audience engagement. Please note:\n\u2022     We do not act as the main source of funding for multi-annual projects. With regard to multi-annual or recurring projects, the Fund mainly funds the additional costs incurred by the Nordic co-operation aspect.\nProjects outside the Nordic region\nAll those working in artistic and cultural fields may apply, as long as the content of the project meets the Fund\u2019s criteria. Individuals, groups, organisations, institutions, associations or businesses may apply. Applicants need not be resident in the Nordic Region or be Nordic citizens.\n"

To tackle climate change, it might be necessary to question current economic models in depth. Therefore, by utilising sci-fi and cli-fi art, the project aims to provide world leaders and the public with a concept of a new imaginary and alternative world.\u00a0\nThe project consists of two elements. One is the explicit focus on economics, and a structured attempt to mobilize the scientific community towards it. The other is an open-source collaborative methodology that invites and channels public participation via online tools. As a result, an idea of a new utopian world is constructed that differs from the one we are living in at the moment but which still is believable in behaviour, dynamics and institutions.\nGlobus Opstart contributes to the development phase in the project by supporting open seminars and travelling costs for the central collaborators and actors.\nRelevance for Globus Opstart:\u2028The project has a utopian but still very interesting idea that is innovative and relevant for the present time. It aims to build up deep relationships and reach global contexts by working with artists and cultural actors outside the Nordic regions. It has the potential of creating new shared values for the future.\nAbout the project:\u2028The Norwegian choreographer Mia Habib has for the past years been working on the project, How to die \u2013 Inopin\u00e9 a transdisciplinary investigation, developed between Ume\u00e5 and Oslo, about ecological grief, cultural panic, and a feeling of collapse.\nIn the Globus Opstart project, the work will be developed further by engaging five dance artists in Brazil, South Africa, Turkey, France and the USA. Instead of working together in the same place, a score is sent to each artist so they can make their adaptation of the work in close interaction with their local communities. The working period will be ended by a local public showing of the solo in each location. All solos will be shown together in 2022 followed by a tour.\u00a0\u00a0\nRelevance for Globus Opstart:\u2028The structure and methods of the project are innovative and meet the criteria for Globus Opstart. The premiere of the original project in Oslo in March was cancelled due to corona, and it is impressive to see how the choreographer adapts to this and develops the work further in a new situation, with equally high quality.\nAbout the project:\u2028How can art build bridges between disciplines? How can artistic practice help address the complex challenges of a world in a climate crisis? How do we make science relevant in cultural life for both human and non-human stakeholders?\u00a0\nThe project invites two perspectives from two different locations to investigate the sign of marine imbalances using seaweed as an artistic material to learn empathy with non-human stakeholders.\nThe collaboration between designers Julia Lohmann and Talisa Dwiyani aims to share the Nordic awareness and knowledge on using the natural phenomena as part of the material exploration process and to be tailored for the local Indonesian seaweed in the Java coastal area.\nRelevance for Globus Opstart:\u2028An exciting project in that it\u2019s connecting the Northern and Southern parts of the globe through a material that is found in both places, and also by challenging materials used in an ancient puppetry tradition in an Indonesian context.\nI am a Multitude\nA cross-cultural art project that focuses on relevant issues and questions of co-existence between people, species and places\n\nThe project received funding because of:\u2028The theme and structure of the project are new-thinking and original. The project contributes positively to local cultures and connects humane culture to environmental discourses by investigating connections between people, species and places. The project works with Nordic themes and collaborations at a high level.\nThe applicant wrote about the project:\u2028The project works towards an exhibition that is planned to be presented at the festival Festpillene i Nord-Norge. It will combine different art forms from sounds and images to performances. The thematic starting point is how different species are co-existing in the world and the symbiotic and complex relationship between these species and people.\u00a0\nThe project seeks to build bridges and to show and illustrate unexpected connections through exploration. The goal is also to arouse curiosity and care for all types of existence. With the exhibition and its tentacles, the project wants to address the specific living conditions in the northern parts of the Nordic region.\nThe collaboration between the three partner organisations aims to help forge closer ties with each other and, with this exhibition programme, contribute with art experiences for a broader and larger audience as well as other arts and cultural actors in the region. Especially during the global pandemic, it has become essential to share knowledge and experiences across different geographical contexts with the similar living condition.\nDance of the Fisherman\nA site-specific performance that investigates and explores fishing traditions in communities and locations in Denmark, Sweden, the Faroe Islands and Ireland\n\nThe project received funding because of:\u2028The project approaches its topic from various perspectives, using interviews and several locations to collect background material. The aims to involve people in local communities adds a personal layer. The project is reworking tradition and cultural heritage in a thought-provoking way.\nThe applicant wrote about the project:\u2028Dance of the Fisherman is a new Nordic site-specific performance created in Denmark, Iceland, Sweden, the Faroe Islands and Ireland by Irish theatre director Caroline McSweeney and Finnish choreographer Taneli T\u00f6rm\u00e4, both based in Denmark.\nThe project investigates fishing and its traditions whilst also looking at the differences between fishing in leisure time and as a more commercial activity. The topic will be explored in different kinds of locations, close to big cities and towns, as well as in isolated locations, where one can still meet old fishing methods and traditions.\nThe main inspiration for this performance will ultimately be derived from the communities and locations where the projects will be created. Creating a strongly influenced Nordic performance with a simultaneous universal narrative for a site-specific Fishing performance.\n"

Last three years, we have developed a clear and more specified approach for the grants.\n\u00a0\nWe see that cultural life changes continuously and, therefore, there is not two similar application. To meet the different needs of applicants, we have developed more customised grants.\n\u00a0\nCultural life is in continuous movement, and no two applicants are identical. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve developed Opstart, Handmade and Puls. In this way, we can celebrate and support diversity and seize trends while they are still new.\n\u00a0\nThe following principles characterise the grants by the Nordic Culture Fund:\n\n\nDEVELOPMENT OF NORDIC RELEVANCE, QUALITY AND CO-OPERATION\nEvery granted initiative and project need to support at least one of the Fund's criteria:\n\u00a0\nNordic relevance\nThe projects and initiatives are, either partly or fully, created and implemented by stakeholders with a Nordic base. The projects extend beyond a national perspective and promote openness and tolerance.\n\u00a0\nQuality of the projects and how they develop art and culture in the Nordic region\nThe projects and initiatives need to reflect their Nordic relevance and mutual significance in local, regional, national and\/or global contexts. The projects need to have\u00a0long-term artistic or cultural ambitions and visions.\n\u00a0\nQuality and substance of the co-operation\nThere have to be a commitment of participating partners, the target groups, and the extent to which the project is embedded in relevant environments.\n\n\n\nRISK-TAKING\nThe Nordic Culture Fund supports unique projects where the Fund's support has a distinct relevance.\n\u00a0\nThe Fund supports risk-taking and\u00a0through its assesment and grants allocation\u00a0functions as a quality stamp for projects and initiatives.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nCO-FUNDING\nThe Project Funding and the thematic programs must have an appropriate level of co-funding. This is a central part of anchoring the projects to its co-operative partners.\n\u00a0\nThe Fund can support the development of smaller project ideas and the start-up phase of Nordic collaborations without requirements of co-funding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

NORDIC CULTURAL FUND - GENERAL INFO\n\nThe aim of the Nordic Cultural Fund is to promote cultural co-operation among the Nordic countries - including the self-governing territories of the Faroe Islands, Greenland and \u00c5land - by making grants\/contributions to co-operation projects. The activity is the result of a separate agreement among the Nordic countries entered into in 1966. \n \nThe annual amount available to the Fund is authorized via the budget for the Nordic Council of Ministers. For 2003, approx. DKK 26,000,000 have been earmarked for the distribution of project grants. \n\nThe Cultural Fund's Board consists of 13 members, two from each Nordic country. They are appointed for a two-year term by the Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers. Furthermore, the Faroe Islands, Greenland and \u00c5land each have a representative on the Board. \n\n2. THE NORDIC EXHIBITION OF THE YEAR\n\nBackground and Aim\n\nIn order to promote major Nordic co-operative projects within the exhibition area the Nordic Cultural Fund has decided to allocate separate funds to the supreme effort \u201dThe Nordic Exhibition of the Year\u201d. The supreme effort is being conducted jointly with the Nordic Museum Committee, which is a group of experts under the Nordic Council of Ministers and which, in this context, functions as the advisory agency of the Cultural Fund. On the Museum Committee each Nordic country is represented by a member who is an expert within the field of museums.\n\nThe \u201dThe Nordic Exhibition of the Year\u201d will not replace or reduce the Fund's ordinary contributions to exhibition activities. Normally, however, contributions do not exceed DKK 500,000, but the \u201dThe Nordic Exhibition of the Year\u201d is a separate effort focused on one extraordinary exhibition project. The contribution is a maximum of DKK 3,000,000 and it will be advertised every two years starting in 2003. \n\nIt is possible to apply for grants for the same exhibition project both from the supreme effort \u201dThe Nordic Exhibition of the Year\u201d and from the Fund's ordinary contribution activities. However, only one of the applications will be eligible. As already mentioned, applications for the Fund's ordinary contribution activities are in respect of minor projects or where the Fund's financial involvement is limited to DKK 500,000. \n  \nIt is the Fund's hope that the \u201dThe Nordic Exhibition of the Year\u201d will, on the one hand, generate increased focus on the North, on Nordic co-operation and on the Nordic countries, and on the other will provide an impetus towards increased co-operation amongst museums in the Nordic countries and contribute towards the implementation of an important exhibition project addressing the general public. \n\nOutline and theme\n\nThe supreme effort \u201dThe Nordic Exhibition of the Year\u201d is not a competition but should be seen as a separate indication on the part of the Fund to support an exhibition project about an important subject. It might, for example, be a reflection on cultural similarities and differences among the Nordic countries. Or a focus on the North as a region in Europe. \n\nThe subject or theme of the exhibition should have a Nordic perspective and should address the public at large. It should somehow include at least three and, preferably, more Nordic countries\/self-governing territories. The theme could be historical, topical and\/or futuristic. \n\nCo-operative exhibitions between the Nordic countries, the Baltic States and northwest Russia, or projects involving the Nordic countries and the rest of Europe may also be considered for grants. In these cases, too, at least three Nordic countries\/self-governing territories must be included in the theme for the exhibition. \n\nFor the exhibition there must be an explanatory exhibition catalogue in at least one Scandinavian language. However, in the case of applications from countries\/territories outside the Scandinavian language area, exemptions may be made.\n\nThe exhibition must be shown in at least two Nordic countries \/self-governing territories. A positive aspect would be if the exhibition has wide geographical spread in the Nordic countries, which means that the exhibition will be shown at several museums. Besides, the exhibition may also be shown outside the Nordic countries. \n\nAn exhibition project that somehow generates increased co-operation or develops new forms of co-operation among several museums in the Nordic countries will be preferred. \n\nEvaluation criteria \n\nThe following overlapping evaluation criteria will be applied:\n\n* The quality of the theme for the exhibition; its specific contents, design and implementation as described in the project plan;\n* the mediation of the theme for the exhibition to different target groups\/interested parties; \n* various ancillary activities in the form of, e.g., lectures and seminars;\n* the prospects of continued co-operation and synergy effects among various  museums\/affected institutions in the Nordic countries; and\n* the planning and financing of the exhibition. \n\nFinancial terms & conditions \n\nThe grant from the Fund to the \u201dThe Nordic Exhibition of the Year\u201d cannot exceed DKK 3,000,000. It is assumed that the museums involved will commit themselves financially to the project and, preferably, seek supplementary financing from other quarters. The grant may be used for production as well as distribution costs.\n\nThe grant from the Fund will be disbursed in three stages: an initial portion (40%) will be paid in connection with the start of the project; thereafter 45% after an approved status report (about halfway through the project); and finally 15% when the project has been concluded and the Fund has approved the final report as well as the financial statement. \n\nReference is otherwise made to the Fund's general guidelines for financial matters and instructions for the requisition of grants. \n\nApplicants \n\nThe grant may be applied for by one or more museums in the Nordic countries. For this purpose the term \"museum\" means an institution, private or public, which is engaged in exhibition activities in one form or the other. Art exhibitions (including architecture, design, etc.) as well as cultural exhibitions and exhibitions of natural history are eligible for grants.\n\nThe museum acting as the formal applicant is the responsible administrative agency for the overall exhibition project. This implies that the administrative agency will present the final report for the project on behalf of all the museums involved.\n\n\n\n"

The project is also important because this professional group often falls outside the scope of funding programmes in the artistic and cultural field.\nComment from the Fund:\nWe want to introduce new generations to the work behind the scenes and motivate those who are already established, as a tendency shows that minorities are dropping out of the music industry way before cis men. Through workshops and mentoring, we will introduce them to the different areas of off-stage work that happens before, during and after a show in production, logistics and engineering.\nObservation of Change\nThe project is based on a nature restoration project that will attempt to minimize the damage that industrially planted spruce trees have begun to cause to naturally growing birch trees due to global warming. Through the restoration project, Observations of Change will artistically illustrate the consequences of human intervention in nature.\n\nThe applicant wrote about the project:\nObservation of Change is an artistic initiative in collaboration with a nature restoration project. The restoration helps nature return to a more pristine form and addresses questions about the interconnectedness of human and more-than-human elements in nature. The artistic approach brings artists and students into dialogue with scientists and creates spaces for reflection on changes in nature and natural cultures.\nThe project received funding because of:\nThe project brings together artistic and scientific methods and creates dialogue between artists and scientists in a joint effort to increase understanding of the consequences of human intervention in nature.\n\nRevisiting the Academiae Aboensis Printing Press\nA revitalisation and reinterpretation of the earliest printing types used in the first Finnish printing house, which existed from 1642-1827. Based on surviving books and copies from the printing house, the project will breathe new life into old printing practices.\n\nThe project received funding because of:\nThis project aims to create a font that has meaning for the local community and adds depth to new artistic works produced at the Letterpress House in Turku. Furthermore, the project is based on a special fact: the wooden fonts that came to Finland in the 16th and 17th centuries were often recycled types handed down from Swedish printers who had imported them from the continent. Their shortcomings have given rise to a specialized language in the local community.\u00a0\nThe new typeface is based on historical books from the printing house and translates its expression to suit the modern needs of artistic book printing.\nThe applicant wrote about the project:\nThe project could have a major impact on graphic design and printing as a craft in the Nordic region. By developing old practices and adapting them to today\u2019s artistic expressions and printing techniques, the relevance of the profession is strengthened in an otherwise highly digitalised world.\n\n\nNUA\nThe project will develop a Nordic network for archaeologists working with urban archaeology. Among other things, the network will ensure that the large amount of current research in the field is shared across the Nordic region.\nThe applicant wrote about the project:\nWe want to develop a Nordic network for archaeologists working with urban archaeology \u2013 both in practice, communication and as a research focus. The process will be initiated by gathering interested parties for a three-day workshop that will serve as the basis for the formation of a formal network. The idea was born out of the great activity that has taken place \u2013 and continues to take place \u2013 in the field over the last 10-15 years. Especially in Norway, Sweden and Denmark, major urban infrastructure projects have resulted in very large archaeological excavations, with significant knowledge growth and new archaeological perspectives.\nComment from the Fund:\nArchaeology, which focuses on life in Nordic cities, is developing rapidly, and therefore there is a great need for projects that can bring together research and ensure that it is communicated to a large audience from the academic community.\n\nContemporary puppetry network Nordic-UA\nContemporary puppetry network Nordic-UA will support Ukrainian puppetry artists by bringing together puppeteers from the Nordic region and Ukraine for a series of workshops that will focus on artistic exchange and common European values such as democracy in the arts and artistic diversity.\n\nThe applicant wrote about the project:\nNordic theater culture is characterized by its unique development, figurative and metaphorical language, development of works for different audiences and cultural elements of performance styles.\nThe project will give Ukrainian puppeteers the opportunity to get acquainted with the Nordic culture and to share their own culture with others. This artistic exchange will be an excellent basis for understanding regional and common cultural traditions and processes, while emphasising Nordic and European cultural values: democratic art that celebrates identity and diversity.\nThe project received funding because of:\nThe project manages to have strong roots in the Nordic region while at the same time reaching out further by including Ukrainian artists in the project. This creates fertile ground for a reinterpretation of what is Nordic while at the same time focussing on Ukrainian artists.\n"

This particular project addresses the global issue of climate change, and the role performing arts has to play in it. Sustainability is seen in terms of human relationships, happiness, and creativity. Through non-violent communication, safe spaces, equality, and awareness of societal oppression, the project creates connections and profounds creative processes for arts. By doing this, the project shows the audience how social acts can find harmony with nature.\nFurthermore, the project aims to create a new sustainable touring concept, called Branch\u00e9, enabling global activities in local contexts. A script is developed in a collaboration between actors in the Nordic countries and Canada, which can be performed in several places afterwards.\nActing for Climate is a Norwegian based performance company that has been developing artistic responses to the global climate crisis since 2015 and continues to search for new creative solutions every day.\nRelevance for Globus Opstart:\u2028The project combines digital and physical working methods for developing a performance concept between Canada and Europe. It aims to develop practices in contemporary circus and find sustainable ways to work in global contexts.\n\nPartnership with the WHO Regional Office for Europe\nThe project will bring together academics, artists, cultural institutions, health care practitioners and policy makers from different countries in exploring effective and sustainable strategies for integrating arts and culture into the wider healthcare sector.\n\u2028Through implementing an arts-based health intervention in Denmark and Romania, the aim of the research is to identify good practices for the implementation of effective and sustainable arts and health interventions, while studying the impact on the local population.\nThe project is led by WHO Europe\u2019s flagship unit on Behavioural and Cultural Insights. To support the development and execution of the project, WHO Europe has partnered with University College London (UK), University of the Arts Helsinki (Finland), BOZAR (the Centre for Fine Arts in Brussels, Belgium), the Central Denmark Region and the Cluj Culture Centre (Romania).\nAccelerating access\u2028\u201cLooking ahead, it is clear that arts-based interventions will one day be an important option for the treatment and prevention of many health conditions,\u201d reflects Andrea Scheel, Technical Officer in the BCI Unit, and project lead. \u201cWe hope that this project will yield interesting and original results, and will help to bring us closer to this future of improved access to arts and health interventions.\u201d\nThe project is part of the Nordic Culture Fund\u2019s Globus programme, which aims to expand the reach of Nordic cultural co-operation by investing in stronger international connections and long-term networks. The Fund is contributing DKK 400,000 to the project, which will support the in-country implementation of the arts and health interventions.\n\u201cWith this project we want to explore how building connections to different actors and initiatives in Europe and globally can strengthen and enrich knowledge and cooperation in the Nordic region, as well as enhance the conditions for mutual exchange of information and best practices across country borders,\u201d states Eline Sigfusson, deputy director of the Nordic Culture Fund and the project manager for Globus. She points out that \u201cdeveloping a consistent and sustainable practice in the field of arts and health requires acknowledging the agency and role of the artist, and ensuring sufficient expertise concerning artistic and cultural procurements goes into the planning and implementation of the interventions.\u201d\nEngaging with the Arts\u2028The aim of the project is twofold. First, to evaluate the impact of the chosen arts-based health interventions on the local population. Second, the project will enable WHO to develop guidance on how to integrate arts and health into the wider health system and make these interventions more accessible to Member States across the European Region.\n\u201cThe project is an exciting and ambitious step forwards,\u201d says Nino Berdzuli, Director of the Division of Country Health Programmes at WHO Europe. \u201cEngaging with the arts is good for you and can tangibly improve lives. While there is increasingly robust research that shows the arts can have a demonstrable impact on health, we still know little about how to implement these interventions at scale and in different cultural contexts. This project is an excellent opportunity to explore these questions further.\u201d\nAbout the project:\u2028The project reflects on the consequences of the Balkan War by sharing life stories of performing artists from the Nordic countries who in various ways share memories of migration from the former Yugoslavia. It aims to make life stories visible and to counteract nationalist ideas that are growing in the Balkans.\nThe project will be a relevant voice that addresses important reflections on the present that are created in conversations between northern and southern Europe. It seeks to shed light on the emotional experiences of migration, with a particular focus on women's experiences of war, conflict and flight, which are often overlooked in the writing of history. By telling personal stories, it strengthens an individual's existence in society, and also gives expression to opposing stereotypes and ethnically based groups in society.\nRelevance for Globus Opstart:\u2028The project works with a relevant theme. The project wants to change simplified and narrow images of the Balkans and it aims to counteract cultural contradictions between ethnic groups.\n\n"

The Fund has developed this in recent years, both with the funding programmes Opstart, Puls and Globus Opstart, and with new criteria for all project support. In addition, the Fund has begun to provide development support to projects characterised by the experimental development of themes, or organisations relevant to the Fund\u2019s strategy and its thematic support programmes. Moreover, as part of the efforts to broaden the circle of key stakeholders in Nordic cultural co-operation and support the Fund\u2019s strategic efforts, the Fund may engage in and award multi-annual development support to new Nordic partnerships.  \n \nThe Fund\u2019s continuous development of differentiated support has allowed us to reach entirely new target groups and facilitate the building up of new, strong relations and forms of co-operation. However, the development of differentiated support also requires the development of an overall view. It is no longer merely a question of considering applications for individual projects, but of developing networks and relations in a long-term perspective. It takes time to build up lasting relations, and sometimes there is also a need to try out different collaborative combinations before the applicants can find out what works, and who they work well with.  \nIn the coming period, the Fund\u2019s financial support will therefore create possibilities for contributing to projects on the basis of a broader overall view and a longer time perspective.  \n \nInitiatives \nAs a cross-cutting strategic initiative, the Fund is working to develop differentiated support in holistically-oriented processes. We are also working to ensure that the Fund\u2019s support programmes will be relevant to applicants in the future, and to identify opportunities for specific thematic initiatives. This means that we work in the following developmental tracks:  \nWe work holistically with the Fund\u2019s applications, and continuously work to create a simple application flow for applicants, and a simple process for decisions and following-up on applications.  \nWe are developing our support programmes with a long-term dimension in mind, so that actors have an improved possibility of creating networks that will provide a foundation for increased quality and innovation.  \nWe work to develop knowledge about trends in funded projects, and we explore the potential of cultural actors and arts institutions for sustainable development in partnership with other foundations.  \nWe work with strategic development support, established in the form of partnerships, so that the partners, including the Nordic Culture Fund, can monitor the projects over a period of time and gain unique and relevant knowledge.  \n \n  \t \n\nENHANCED GLOBAL FOCUS \n \n \nWhat do we see?  \nThe global perspective has been a strategic focus area for the Nordic Culture Fund during the first period of the strategy. For historical reasons, the global perspective is in many ways a natural one for the Nordic Culture Fund. The Fund was established immediately after the Second World War as an autonomous organisation, with the aim of working internationally in the Nordic Region and beyond. There has long been a clear, common international focus in the Nordic countries. But in these times, political interest in international arts and cultural co-operation appears to be on the wane.  \n \nThrough the analysis of applications, and after dialogue with many actors from the cultural sector in the Nordic countries and around the world, the Fund has observed that our surroundings and our cultural projects have become increasingly borderless, and that this is a time of change in which the models that used to characterise international action are no longer as relevant as they previously were. The startingpoint for many approaches and initiatives in the Nordic countries with the \u2018internationalisation\u2019 agenda argues for the relevance of seeing oneself in relation to the world, and the world in relation to oneself. Many countries simultaneously act with conflicting demands for a national focus and a competitive strategy in relation to the rest of the world. With a declining interest in international cultural co-operation in the Nordic countries and in the official Nordic co-operation, the Fund has also wished to provide an alternative to the requirement of national affiliation or national or regional purposes for international co-operation.  \n \nShortly before the world was hit by the onset of the Covid-19 epidemic, the Nordic Culture Fund launched Globus: a new programme designed to give artists and cultural actors new opportunities to seek funding support, in a less conditional manner than previously, for projects that extend beyond the Nordic Region. The new global initiative was aimed at expanding perspectives on Nordic art and culture. With Globus, the Fund wished to think about cultural support in a different way. The new programme was initially tested in a few selected pilot projects, in which we wished to obtain concrete experience with projects that could lead to a more open support programme with diverse approaches. Through this work, the Fund co-operated with a number of different partners both inside and outside the Nordic Region who could help to ensure a broader financing basis and a long-term focus.  \nThe launch of Globus generated such a high level of interest that in the autumn of \n2020, the Fund launched Globus Opstart as a new support programme.  \n \nInitiatives \nGlobus has already proved itself as an example of how to build bridges between different cultural and professional environments, provide new perspectives on cultural life, and contribute to new understandings of the interaction between the local and the global. The Fund will continue this work and will provide inspiration for new models of international cultural co-operation, including at national level.  The cross-cutting strategic initiative must be characterised by the following:  \nWe will explore new tracks and arenas for artists and cultural practitioners in a global context, and we will collaborate with resource persons who can contribute knowledge of relevant artistic and cultural arenas in key international art and culture environments.  \nWe will experiment with new formats and create artist platforms as well as facilitating deep and sustainable networks that can possess global relevance.  \nWe will participate in global networks that discuss the development of art and culture.   \t \n"

Arctic needlework is somewhat foreign as a concept, and there is no equivalent word for tundra. The exhibition and workshop highlight skills that are disappearing.\nRelevance for Globus Opstart:\nThe project is focusing on networking in a global context and gives an insight into an original culture and lifestyle. The project\u2019s global vision is based on the latest research on the Arctic region and research in experimental cultural research areas in a large area in change.\nDVA\nThe project will develop a cultural dissemination center about the Hadza people.\nAbout the project:\nThe Hadzas are one of the world\u2019s last living hunter-gatherers. In collaboration with the Hadza people, the project will contribute to creating a cultural center where the Hadzas themselves will tell about what it means to be a Hadza. The center will be a valuable source of information about who they are.\nRelevance for Globus Opstart:\nThe project contributes to the world\u2019s cultural heritage, sustainable tourism and research. There is a growing global interest in human basic design, nature and species characteristics, due to the impending and necessary green agenda. The Hadzas are studied evolutionarily as an example of our common basic design \u2013 and their way of life is a global cultural heritage.\n"

The agreement is intergovernmental, and any changes to the agreement must be ratified by each Nordic country. \n \nThe Nordic Culture Fund is an independent legal entity associated with the Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers.  \n \nThe Nordic Culture Fund is bound and managed by a board, the 13 members of which are appointed by the Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers. Each Nordic country is represented by two participants, while the Faroe Islands, Greenland and \u00c5land each have one representative.  \n \nThe Fund currently has a budget of approximately DKK 36 million. The Nordic Culture Fund\u2019s grant is financed from the budget of the Nordic Council of Ministers, as approved by the Nordic Council.  \n \nAccording to its agreement, the Fund may also receive other financing for its purposes. This has been done through the establishment of the Fund\u2019s thematic initiative, Puls, in which additional funding was provided by the Nordic Council of Ministers, the Danish Arts Foundation, the Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture and the Swedish government. During the initial period of the strategy, the Fund has succeeded in optimising resources by partnering with private foundations, organisations and cultural institutions on projects that support the Fund\u2019s purpose and the overall objectives of the strategy. \n \nOn an annual basis, the Fund allocates support to around 250 cultural projects within and outside the Nordic Region. It also supports, creates and participates in the promotion, development and communication of knowledge of art and culture, and stimulates the development of cultural policy in the Nordic Region.  \n \n \n \n \nOverall objectives \nMISSION \nThe Nordic Culture Fund works to support an innovative and dynamic artistic and cultural life in the Nordic Region that is diverse, accessible and of high quality.  \n \nThrough this mission, we wish to stimulate the development of art and culture in the Nordic Region, as well as in a global context. A qualitatively well-functioning sphere of art and culture helps to develop the creative communities and milieux that characterise the Nordic Region. This is the foundation for ensuring that art and culture can be free and open to new encounters, new players and new discoveries.  \nOVERALL OBJECTIVES \nThe Nordic Culture Fund has three overall objectives. Common to all activities of the Fund in the coming period is that they will support one or more of these three objectives.  \n \nThe Nordic Culture Fund will promote the production, innovation and communication of arts and culture in the Nordic Region and globally. \n \nThe Nordic Culture Fund must work on the basis of knowledge-based administration of its grants. These grants must help to improve the possibilities for artists and cultural players to jointly create quality, and thereby produce and communicate art and cultural expressions with Nordic relevance, in both Nordic and global contexts. In its grant allocation, the Fund will support risk-taking, networking and knowledge development. As a general rule, the Fund does not provide support for the basic financing of companies, but may support the start-up phase of artistic and cultural activities.  \n \nThe Nordic Culture Fund will promote artistic and cultural networks within the Nordic cultural co-operation.  \n \nNetworking, knowledge-sharing and mutual inspiration are essential to ensure that the work of the Fund is anchored in art and culture in the Nordic Region, and that the Fund continues to have a legitimate role in Nordic cultural co-operation. Besides supporting the formation of long-term relations through financial support, the Fund will work proactively to promote and participate in networks, e.g. in specific sectors and at regional, national and international level.  \n \nThe Nordic Culture Fund will develop and communicate knowledge of arts and cultural life in order to stimulate the development of cultural policy in the Nordic Region.  \n \nThe Nordic Culture Fund is uniquely positioned to play a role as an active disseminator of knowledge, creating new possibilities and structures in order to collect and convey knowledge of art and culture. The Fund must hereby stimulate the development of cultural policy discussions in order to support and influence the opportunities for art and culture to develop and form a significant, legitimate and contemporary part of society in the Nordic Region and the rest of the world. \n \n \nCross-cutting strategic initiatives  \nOn the basis of the overall objectives, we have formulated four cross-cutting strategic initiatives, each of which supports the overall objectives, thereby setting the direction for the Fund\u2019s work in the coming period.  \n \nThe four strategic initiatives reflect development potentials and challenges that the Fund\u2019s secretariat, experts and board have previously analysed and discussed with resource persons in separate strategic networks. In addition, they reflect the work of the Fund on the strategy in the initial years, which forms the basis for adjusting and extending the strategy. Finally, they are an expression of efforts in areas where we can see that the Fund can continue its development and make a difference. Although the four initiatives have a mutual influence on each other, they are presented separately in the following sections.  \n \n \n \n"

NORDIC CULTURAL FUND - GENERAL INFO\n\nThe aim of the Nordic Cultural Fund is to promote cultural co-operation among the Nordic countries - including the self-governing territories of the Faroe Islands, Greenland and \u00c5land - by making grants\/contributions to co-operation projects. The activity is the result of a separate agreement among the Nordic countries entered into in 1966. \n \nThe annual amount available to the Fund is authorized via the budget for the Nordic Council of Ministers. For 2003, approx. DKK 26,000,000 have been earmarked for the distribution of project grants. \n\nThe Cultural Fund's Board consists of 13 members, two from each Nordic country. They are appointed for a two-year term by the Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers. Furthermore, the Faroe Islands, Greenland and \u00c5land each have a representative on the Board. \n\n2. THE NORDIC EXHIBITION OF THE YEAR\n\nBackground and Aim\n\nIn order to promote major Nordic co-operative projects within the exhibition area the Nordic Cultural Fund has decided to allocate separate funds to the supreme effort \u201dThe Nordic Exhibition of the Year\u201d. The supreme effort is being conducted jointly with the Nordic Museum Committee, which is a group of experts under the Nordic Council of Ministers and which, in this context, functions as the advisory agency of the Cultural Fund. On the Museum Committee each Nordic country is represented by a member who is an expert within the field of museums.\n\nThe \u201dThe Nordic Exhibition of the Year\u201d will not replace or reduce the Fund's ordinary contributions to exhibition activities. Normally, however, contributions do not exceed DKK 500,000, but the \u201dThe Nordic Exhibition of the Year\u201d is a separate effort focused on one extraordinary exhibition project. The contribution is a maximum of DKK 3,000,000 and it will be advertised every two years starting in 2003. \n\nIt is possible to apply for grants for the same exhibition project both from the supreme effort \u201dThe Nordic Exhibition of the Year\u201d and from the Fund's ordinary contribution activities. However, only one of the applications will be eligible. As already mentioned, applications for the Fund's ordinary contribution activities are in respect of minor projects or where the Fund's financial involvement is limited to DKK 500,000. \n  \nIt is the Fund's hope that the \u201dThe Nordic Exhibition of the Year\u201d will, on the one hand, generate increased focus on the North, on Nordic co-operation and on the Nordic countries, and on the other will provide an impetus towards increased co-operation amongst museums in the Nordic countries and contribute towards the implementation of an important exhibition project addressing the general public. \n\nOutline and theme\n\nThe supreme effort \u201dThe Nordic Exhibition of the Year\u201d is not a competition but should be seen as a separate indication on the part of the Fund to support an exhibition project about an important subject. It might, for example, be a reflection on cultural similarities and differences among the Nordic countries. Or a focus on the North as a region in Europe. \n\nThe subject or theme of the exhibition should have a Nordic perspective and should address the public at large. It should somehow include at least three and, preferably, more Nordic countries\/self-governing territories. The theme could be historical, topical and\/or futuristic. \n\nCo-operative exhibitions between the Nordic countries, the Baltic States and northwest Russia, or projects involving the Nordic countries and the rest of Europe may also be considered for grants. In these cases, too, at least three Nordic countries\/self-governing territories must be included in the theme for the exhibition. \n\nFor the exhibition there must be an explanatory exhibition catalogue in at least one Scandinavian language. However, in the case of applications from countries\/territories outside the Scandinavian language area, exemptions may be made.\n\nThe exhibition must be shown in at least two Nordic countries \/self-governing territories. A positive aspect would be if the exhibition has wide geographical spread in the Nordic countries, which means that the exhibition will be shown at several museums. Besides, the exhibition may also be shown outside the Nordic countries. \n\nAn exhibition project that somehow generates increased co-operation or develops new forms of co-operation among several museums in the Nordic countries will be preferred. \n\nEvaluation criteria \n\nThe following overlapping evaluation criteria will be applied:\n\n* The quality of the theme for the exhibition; its specific contents, design and implementation as described in the project plan;\n* the mediation of the theme for the exhibition to different target groups\/interested parties; \n* various ancillary activities in the form of, e.g., lectures and seminars;\n* the prospects of continued co-operation and synergy effects among various  museums\/affected institutions in the Nordic countries; and\n* the planning and financing of the exhibition. \n\nFinancial terms & conditions \n\nThe grant from the Fund to the \u201dThe Nordic Exhibition of the Year\u201d cannot exceed DKK 3,000,000. It is assumed that the museums involved will commit themselves financially to the project and, preferably, seek supplementary financing from other quarters. The grant may be used for production as well as distribution costs.\n\nThe grant from the Fund will be disbursed in three stages: an initial portion (40%) will be paid in connection with the start of the project; thereafter 45% after an approved status report (about halfway through the project); and finally 15% when the project has been concluded and the Fund has approved the final report as well as the financial statement. \n\nReference is otherwise made to the Fund's general guidelines for financial matters and instructions for the requisition of grants. \n\nApplicants \n\nThe grant may be applied for by one or more museums in the Nordic countries. For this purpose the term \"museum\" means an institution, private or public, which is engaged in exhibition activities in one form or the other. Art exhibitions (including architecture, design, etc.) as well as cultural exhibitions and exhibitions of natural history are eligible for grants.\n\nThe museum acting as the formal applicant is the responsible administrative agency for the overall exhibition project. This implies that the administrative agency will present the final report for the project on behalf of all the museums involved.\n\n\n"

Taking Nordic short films to new venues is an endeavour worth supporting. The programme includes films from all five Nordic countries.\nThose who attend the screenings not only enjoy a cinematic experience, but also encounter other Nordic cultures and languages, and see topical reports from around the Region.\nYou really get a feel for a project\u2019s importance when it brings together more than 200 people \u2013 late at night, outdoors in August on Tj\u00e4rholmen in Helsinki \u2013 to watch 14 Nordic short films.\nIn 2012, the event Short Films for the People! was held for the eighth time. Each year, it has a different theme, but the Nordic aspect is always prominent. In 2012, the event was part of the programme for Helsinki Design Capital for the first time, and all screenings in Helsinki were held outdoors. Short Films for the People! also visited Porvoo, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Kemi\u00f6nsaari, Hanko, Kristiinankaupunki, Vaasa and Salo.\nShort films have few distribution channels. Aficionados of the art form mainly indulge their passion at film festivals, but the general public is rarely afforded any such opportunity. Our aim is to present top-class Nordic short films to the general public, and in doing so find new audiences.\nWe screened short films from Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Sweden and Finland. The screenings were organised at sites where it was possible to meet and surprise a brand-new audience, i.e. parks, caf\u00e9s and bars.\u00a0\nThe films were obtained via our Nordic partners, e.g. the Norwegian Film Institute, production companies and directors from all over the Nordic Region. The main organisers looked after the funding for the event, the choice of films, securing rights, the production of the film collage and the screenings in Helsinki.\n\nThe Nordic Songwriters\u2019 Circle is an exciting, high profile, high quality project with a distinctly Nordic dimension and scope. Songwriters from all across the Region will attend workshops in Norway, Denmark and the Faroe Islands. The project is of interest and relevance to the Nordic Culture Fund because it aims to enhance the status of Nordic songwriters beyond the Region.\nSongwriting is very much about getting your music to the right people \u2013 often people who work in large international companies that receive thousands of songs a year. The Nordic countries are known for successful artists, but apart from Sweden, they have not established reputations for songwriting.\nThe Nordic Songwriters\u2019 Circle is a collaboration between Songwriters\u2019 Circle Stavanger (Norway), Engelsholm Folk High School (Denmark) and the Nordic House in Torshavn (Faroe Islands). Its objectives are to promote Nordic co-operation in songwriting, enhance the international status of Nordic songwriting and inspire young local artists. The project brings together professional songwriters from Denmark, the Faroe Islands, Norway, Iceland and Sweden, plus three from the USA, in workshops in Torshavn, at Engelsholm Folk High School and in Stavanger. The participants will split into groups to write new songs, which will be performed on the final day of the three workshops.\nSongwriters\u2019 Circle Stavanger has been inviting internationally renowned songwriters to attend workshops along with local and national songwriters since 2007. The Circle has demonstrated that collaboration on songwriting boosts the chances of success and of making a living from music.\n\n\nThe project has a relevant Nordic dimension. The event has a certain relevance as a cultural happening and as a forum in which to present and discuss the genre. The aim is to bolster existing networks and generate new multilateral Nordic activities.\nTeater Albatross is a professional free-theatre group with plenty of international experience. We have toured and participated in exchanges with more than 20 countries. Nordic co-operation has always been to the fore. To celebrate our 30th anniversary, we wanted to organise an international theatre festival and fill the venue with performing artists from all over the world.\nThe festival programme consisted of lots of exciting performances, as well as lectures, music and films. All of the invited theatre groups work in a tradition in which body and movement complement an oral narrative that explores important subjects. The programme also included interesting talks and panel discussions about the free theatre movement, physical theatre and trends in different countries over the last 30 years.\nThe Nordic Region has a strong free-theatre tradition, and it was therefore was interesting for the public to see the performances and hear the Nordic guests talk about their work. On major theme was theatre as a strong social force at national and international level. The aim was to draw comparisons between the conditions for theatre in different countries. There are major differences between the Nordic countries, not least in the work relating to gender and equality"

For further information regarding activities given priority by the Fund, please see the Fund\u00b4s guidelines.\nThe Fund emphasizes knowledge and open minds. \u2028\u2028The Nordic countries, amongst many other areas, is a region where people\u2019s everyday life is becoming more and more internationalized; characterized by increased competition and quick changes, new possibilities and increased freedom of choice. This development requires the people to be brave enough to confront things that are new and unknown. Only when we are safe in the knowledge of our own history and culture, do we dare to wonder about that which is different. For the Fund, the core aspects of the culture is therefore knowledge and an opening up our minds; that people experience cultural differences as an enrichment of their daily lives. \u2028\u2028Our cultural heritage is part of our present. The Nordic countries and their people have individual histories and cultural heritages, but also a partly shared history and similarities in the development of their societies.\u00a0 \u2028\u2028In order to better understand our present, the Fund wishes to stimulate activities, which in a number of different ways increase the historic link between the Nordic countries and their people.

Globally, the Nordic Region is the world\u2019s twelfth largest economy. Culture and art form one of the cornerstones of the Region\u2019s extensive co-operation, and art and culture help to give the Nordic Region an ever-increasing significance in relation to the rest of the world. This is the area in which the Nordic Culture Fund operates, and it is here that we can make a difference.  \n \nThe Nordic Culture Fund has been working in the area of cultural co-operation since 1966, on the basis of an agreement between the Nordic countries. The Fund is an independent body which was intended from the start to be able to act freely and rapidly, without having to be subject to review by national interests.  \n \nUser and stakeholder surveys of the Nordic Culture Fund in 2018 and 2021 show that the fund is currently creating value in several areas of Nordic arts and culture. In particular, the Fund contributes to extending Nordic networks and contacts. Such networks and contacts provide the starting-point for developing new and innovative methods, approaches and activities to enhance the artistic quality of both the supported projects and of Nordic arts and cultural life in general. At the same time, the Fund contributes to increasing the accessibility of art and culture and the international range of artists. However, we have also identified a number of challenges, trends and factors that we will need to address in our work going forward. Accordingly, in this strategy we have identified three overall objectives and four cross-cutting strategic focus areas that will set the direction for our work in the coming period.  \n \nThe Nordic Culture Fund operates in a well-developed sphere of Nordic art and cultural life. For many years, the Nordic countries have enjoyed an extensive cultural life, characterised by strong engagement from the state, civil society and citizens. However, the Nordic welfare societies have also undergone major changes over the past 30 years, which have meant a change in the role of cultural policy, art and culture in general. At the same time, artistic identity is in rapid development, pushing the boundaries of who can be considered artists and cultural practitioners.  \n \nThe arts and culture may be seen as a force in their own right, but they are also crucial to our well-being and our ability to create sustainable societies, and in developing the relationship between centre and periphery. The Nordic countries have something to offer in the world arena. The 17 UN global goals have given us a common language for the planet\u2019s sustainable development until 2030. The role of culture in this connection is not clear, and a need has arisen to reflect on how art and culture contribute to the development of a sustainable world. Here, the Nordic Region has the opportunity to play a leading role.  \n \nThe Nordic Culture Fund may be regarded as a public player with independent funds, the distribution of which does not derive from directly politically-controlled decisions. This position has become even more important in our own day, and must form the starting-point for the future work of the Fund. Through this strategy, we aim to ensure that culture can be without borders and open to encounters \u2013 so that all Nordic citizens, young and old, can enjoy the same right to participate in cultural civil society, and so that Nordic relevance can be enhanced and renewed, with a global focus in mind.  \n \n\n \nThe Nordic Culture Fund\u2019s strategy was adopted in 2018. After two and a half years during which most of the strategy period has been and continues to be impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, the Fund, like other organisations in the Nordic Region, has found it necessary to extend and adjust its strategy.  \n \nWith this extended strategy, we wish to emphasise co-operation in arts and culture as an essential key to the future, especially after a time in which countries have chosen to solve essential global issues individually \u2013 and in particular when we are constantly being reminded of the link between the local and global, the question of centre and periphery, the new public sphere of digitalisation, a changing artistic identity, changing audience experiences and a lack of cohesion and community.  \n \nUnfortunately, cultural co-operation in has been downgraded in the official Nordic co-operation. Moreover, this has occurred at a time when the arts and culture sector is in deep crisis as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and when countries are investing significantly at national level to ensure that cultural life survives and can be rekindled after the pandemic. \n \nWith this extended strategy, we therefore wish to highlight the importance of the strategy\u2019s three overarching objectives, each of which, in its own way, acts as a catalyst for the development of arts and culture and cohesion in the Nordic Region. At the same time, we are adjusting our cross-cutting efforts in order to build on our experiences from the first period of the strategy and work towards engaging even more actors in Nordic cultural co-operation and work in the future, so that we can produce concrete examples and demonstrate the enormous importance that art and culture has for our lives and future, both within and outside the Nordic Region.  \n \n "

        "texts":"\n\nThe fund has received a total of 1,131 applications in in 2021. This is slightly fewer than in 2020 and 2019. The drop in applications has to do with the COVID-19 pandemic as a continual factor of uncertainty in 2021. However, application numbers are still high and comparable to the years before 2019. \nTowards the end of 2021, we have noticed an increase in the number of applications and activities. Furthermore, we have seen how ongoing, supported projects, impressively, are able to reach their targets through meaningful project adjustments and collaborations with their partners, in spite of the uncertainty and unpredictability.\nThe continued high numbers of applications received is testimony that the support programmes of the Nordic Culture Fund are attractive for the field of culture in the Nordics and globally. These support programmes are sufficiently open to embrace the terms and perspectives of the art and culture projects \u2013 also in a period characterized by uncertainty.\nWhile the numbers of applications for Project Support and Opstart have dropped, the numbers for Puls are at the same level as previous years, and there is much interest in the fund's new support programme Globus Opstart. This interest underlines the Globus programme's inherent relevance and opportunities for constellations of cooperation that were not seen before \u2013 both \n\nfor actors in and outside the Nordics. The international scope \t14 and reach that the fund has achieved through Globus Opstart is completely unique in a period with limited possibilities for international cooperation.\nIf, for example, we look at the Nordic countries' participation in the projects supported by the fund within Project Support, we see a changed picture in 2021 compared to 2022 and before. Generally, there are fewer countries involved in a given project which is a natural consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the experiences with COVID in 2020, the projects have decided to use fewer external partners and fewer physical meeting venues.\nThe figure below on the left-hand side how many of the 112 supported projects have had a Nordic country involved, either because the country is represented with project partners or project participants, or because the project has had activities in the country in question.\nPercentually then, the Nordic countries' involvement in the supported projects within Project Support are as follows: Denmark \n70 %, Sweden 66 %, Norway 63 %, Finland 54 %, Iceland 34, the Faroe Islands 11 %, Greenland 8 % and \u00c5land 5 %.\n\n\nOn average, the projects were supported with 159,000 DKK each, but funding for the individual projects ranges from 19,000 DKK to 475,000 DKK. This shows that the fund's Project Support is relevant for both small- and large-scale projects. Also, it illustrates that the fund is accessible for a diverse field of applications.\nThe number of applications for Project Support has gone down from 2019 to 2021 due to COVID-19. The pandemic led to increased uncertainty in cultural life and has also hindered meetings across national borders.\nHowever, in the last round of applications (deadline October 1st), we have seen an increase in the number as well as the quality of the applications which indicates that artistic and cultural actors are now reacting with greater optimism after two years burdened by difficult financial and planning conditions due to the pandemic and the attendant restrictions.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021 we have continued our practice from 2020 whereby the Opstart support was mainly meant for fees, materials and other necessary requirements in terms of being able to fulfil the Opstart project. Under normal circumstances the Opstart support is typically used for travel expenses. But in order to ensure that Opstart continued to be relevant for the field of art and culture in a time of restrictions we have operated with more accessible criteria. \nThe number of Opstart applications have been rising from 2015 \u2013 where the programme was launched \u2013 to 2019 where Opstart became a permanent support programme. In 2020 and 2021 the fund has received fewer applications for Opstart support. But it is worth noticing that Opstart, with a total of 294 applications in 2021, remains in high demand. The drop in applications is a natural consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Another reason is the launch of Globus Opstart which is now an obvious alternative for projects with a Nordic-global focus.\n\n\n\n\n2021 was the last year the fund gave grants through the Puls wing of our efforts. The grants were given for cooperation and concerts in 2021 and throughout 2022. In the last phase of the effort, we focussed on anchoring and future perspectives.\nPuls consists of three interacting and complementary parts: A support programme targeted at concert organizers, a network for the so-called Puls-organizers (concert organizers) and development work in cultural politics.\nIn 2021, the Puls-organizers have \u2013 just like in 2020 \u2013 been challenged by the many restrictions throughout the year. That is why the fund has been particularly forthcoming concerning changes, postponements or cancellations for the Puls concerts. But unlike in 2020, it has to a larger extent been possible for Puls organizers to actually hold the Puls concerts in 2021.\nIt was also possible for the fund and the Puls organizers to meet in Reykjavik in November 2021 for the annual network meeting. Focus was on resuming the dialogue, developing new constellations of cooperation and discussing future versions of the network.\n\n\n"

That is why the fund is launching the new global initiative, which will expand perspectives on Nordic art and culture.\n\u00a0\nUnlike the fund's other programmes such as Puls, Handmade and Opstart, there is no criterion for regional co-operation in the programme. On the contrary, we aim to support projects that cannot be implemented in the Nordic region alone.\n\u00a0\nIn this way, we intend to stimulate projects that use art and creativity as a catalyst for conversations with the younger generations and the new citizens of the Nordic countries; projects that will help to develop the public space, creating new communities that can rise above the languages and differences that separate us, and causing new things to arise in our common democracy.\n\n\n\n\n\nGLOBAL VERSUS INTERNATIONAL\nWe view the global as borderless - the world as a united whole.\nThe international is defined by the borders between nations, so its scale is narrower than the global, as is implied by the word itself: inter-national.\n\u2028Global\u00a0We will create global relevance for the Nordic co-operation.\nInternational\u00a0We will participate in international networks.\n\n\n\nNew funding programme in 2022\nIn the first two years of the programme 2020-2021, Globus has included the sub-programme Globus Opstart and selected pilot projects. In 2022, the programme will expand with a new perennial funding programme, based on experiences and knowledge gained in the first phase of the programme.\n\u00a0\nThe purpose of the multi-track model is to ensure an exploratory and cross-cutting approach with relevant perspectives and diverse expressions.\n\u00a0\nThe new funding programme is expected to be launched in Spring 2022. More information about the new programme and application dates will be published in January.\n\nPilot projects and global partnerships\nIn the first phase of the programme in 2020-2021, the fund has initiated specific pilot projects and established partnerships with actors in and outside the Nordic region. In these projects, we work with a number of different partners, which help to ensure a broader funding and a long-term focus. The projects are based on and aim for long-term collaboration and networking, which supports the concept of establishing a global focus with long, sustainable collaborations.\n\u00a0\nOn our website you can read more about the following projects:\n\u00a0\nResearch and documentation of young artists' global practices \u2013 collaboration with Talent Norway 2020-2021\nThe project has investigated what it takes for younger talented artists to realize their dream projects based on global collaboration.\n\u00a0\nArts & Health Collective \u2013 collaboration with WHO\nThe project brings together academics, artists, cultural institutions, healthcare professionals and decision-makers from several different countries in exploring effective and sustainable strategies to integrate art and culture broadly into the healthcare sector.\n\u00a0\nCritical Voices - co-operation with UNESCO\nThe project seeks to strengthen the dialogue on the diversity of cultural forms of expression and the diverse role of cultural policy in the world.\n\n\nGlobus Opstart\nGlobus Opstart is a funding programme within the fund's overall Globus initiative.\n\u00a0\nGlobus Opstart supports the establishment and research phases in mutual global collaborations and projects involving artists and cultural practitioners from the Nordic region and other parts of the world.\n\u00a0\nThere is an ongoing application deadline, and you can apply for max. DKK 50,000. There is no requirement for co-financing of Globus Opstart.\n\u00a0\nABOUT GLOBUS OPSTART\nThe programme focuses in particular on projects that operate with an exploratory approach in building collaborations and seeking new knowledge in order to develop and strengthen their practice in a global framework.\n\u00a0\nWe encourage applicants therefore to think new in terms of idea, theme as well as networking and collaboration. And we encourage applicants with the projects to investigate and establish clear structures and project organizations, which can lead to the formation of global networks, characterized by deep relations and duration.\n\u00a0\nWe welcome projects that work with both the Global South and the Global North. The projects can both include physical meetings and\/or be developed by using digital platforms and tools.\n\u00a0\nThe projects must be clearly linked to artistic and\/or cultural environments. The Nordic Culture Fund does not fund projects that focus primarily on, for example, sporting events, business development, technological development and innovation, the social area, journalism or social science.\n\n\n\nWhen assessing applications:\n\t\tThe project must have a Nordic anchoring but must not be able to be developed in the Nordic region alone. Support from the fund is dependent on binding participation and contributions from artists and cultural practitioners who are working outside the Nordic Region. We also look at how the project\u2019s cooperation is reflected in the budget.\n\t\tWe look at how the project works with an exploratory approach in building collaborations, seeking out new knowledge and qualifications and thereby developing their practice in a global framework.\n\t\tWe look at how the project thinks new in terms of idea, theme and in relation to the establishment of networks and collaboration and artistic development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Last three years, we have developed a clear and more specified approach for the grants.\n\u00a0\nWe see that cultural life changes continuously and, therefore, there is not two similar application.

The projects extend beyond a national perspective and promote openness and tolerance.\n\u00a0\nQuality of the projects and how they develop art and culture in the Nordic region\nThe projects and initiatives need to reflect their Nordic relevance and mutual significance in local, regional, national and\/or global contexts. The projects need to have\u00a0long-term artistic or cultural ambitions and visions.\n\u00a0\nQuality and substance of the co-operation\nThere have to be a commitment of participating partners, the target groups, and the extent to which the project is embedded in relevant environments.\nRISK-TAKING\nThe Nordic Culture Fund supports unique projects where the Fund's support has a distinct relevance.\n\u00a0\nThe Fund supports risk-taking and\u00a0through its assesment and grants allocation\u00a0functions as a quality stamp for projects and initiatives.\u00a0\u00a0\nCO-FUNDING\nThe Project Funding and the thematic programs must have an appropriate level of co-funding. This is a central part of anchoring the projects to its co-operative partners.\n\u00a0\nThe Fund can support the development of smaller project ideas and the start-up phase of Nordic collaborations without requirements of co-funding."

With Globus Opstart, we wanted to explore how global cooperation is done and developed between artists and cultural practioners from the Nordics and the rest of the world.\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the supported Globus Opstart projects we see that \t25 they share the ambition to establish and deepen collaborations and connections across national borders. In spite of a global pandemic and restrictions, they demonstrate innovation and strong creativity in relation to idea development, choice of method and formation of collaborations.\nAmong the supported initiatives we find, for example, a project challenging the stigma around mental health through performance and physical theatre based on a collaboration between Zimbabwean and Danish artists, in addition to a digital performance made by artists from Troms\u00f8 and Murmansk, addressing current problems in a post-COVID-19 world.\nEven if Globus Opstart does not require regional, Nordic cooperation, these projects have managed to create an entirely new meaning of Nordic relevance on a global basis.\nThe fund received a total of 174 applications for Globus Opstart in 2021, and the programme has clearly worked very well as a supplement to the other support programmes, Project Support and Opstart. The fact that we have received so many applications tells us that Globus Opstart has been in high demand and that it actually covers a new need.\n\n\nFrom 2020, the fund has worked with Development Support as a new kind of funding for strategic partnerships and development projects that are not covered by the other support programmes within the fund. The overall drop in the number of applications has been an incentive and an opportunity for the fund to rethink its resources as a way to support projects of a more long-term and more development-focused character.\nDevelopment support is given to projects characterized by an experimental development of themes that are relevant in terms the strategy of the fund and\/or the development of the fund's thematical efforts and programmes. Within the programme of Development Support, it is also possible to form multi-annual framework agreements with partners working to develop relevant subjects or initiatives in the strategy of the Nordic Culture Fund or partners who otherwise support the aims of the fund.\nThe development projects are developed in closer collaboration with Nordic Culture Fund than projects supported by other programmes of the fund. This enables both parties, the Nordic Culture Fund included, to monitor these projects across a defined period of time and gain unique and relevant knowledge thereby.\n\nManagement\nIn its management and business conduct, the Nordic Culture Fund emphasizes the importance of legally sound and safe board decisions, high levels of competence in the work of our experts in terms of assessments and priorities and, finally, an efficient secretariat to handle the day-to-day operation. The board, the experts and the secretariat are the three central parts of the organization, and together they make sure that the fund succeeds in its strategy.\n\nThe governing body of the Nordic Culture Fund is the board. Its \n13 members are appointed by the Nordic Council and the Nordic \nCouncil of Ministers for two years at a time. Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden are represented by two board members each: One elected politician, who is a member of the Nordic Council, and one professional or civil servant appointed by the Nordic Council of Ministers. Faroe Islands, Greenland and \u00c5land are represented by one board member each. The board operates on the basis of a set of standing orders on procedure for the fund.\nThe chairmanship is biennial and alternates between Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. In 2020-2021, Norway has had the chairmanship in the board. In 2021, two board meetings were held. The first one was in May, conducted digitally, and the second meeting in November conducted in a hybrid format with both online and in-person attendance.\n\nExperts\nThe Nordic Culture Fund uses experts to evaluate applications and give the fund an assessment of the artistic and cultural quality as well as relevance in terms of cultural policy. These are sectorial experts with a high degree of professional legitimacy, and the professionally qualified work they do is tremendously important for the fund.\nThe system is built on a rotation scheme whereby the experts serve for a three-year period and roughly half of them are substituted every second year. The practice of the fund is to invite proposals of experts from the national authorities for cultural support.\nIn 2021, this group of experts comprises 20 experts from Denmark, Finland, Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and the \u00c5land.\n\n\nThe secretariat conducts the day-to-day business of the fund from the offices in the Nordic House in Copenhagen. The secretariat is headed by a director hired by the board. \nThe work of the secretariat includes all elements of the business related to implementation of strategy, processing of applications and assisting the board and the group of experts.\n2021-24 the fund is faced with budget cuts decided by the ministers of Nordic Cooperation. Therefore, the fund works strategically to adjust its budget \u2013 without compromising on the quality of management, funding service or strategic efforts. \n\nCommunication\nAt the Nordic Culture Fund, we work strategically with our communication as a legitimate support provider, a professional collaborator and an inspiring actor in the development of art and cultural policy.\nIn the spring of 2021, the consultancy firm Oxford Research conducted a user survey among the fund's applicants. The purpose was to give us insights into the applicants' satisfaction with and knowledge of the fund's support programmes in terms of the strategic development of the fund. Moreover, it was a specific aim to establish more solid, in-depth data on how applicants, support beneficiaries and key employees assessed and evaluated the fund's thematical efforts within the Globus programme.\nThe results of the survey show that the fund has succeeded in streamlining the communication with applicants and rendering the project journey from application to finished project more flexible. Furthermore, the profiling of the fund as a catalyst and its capability to accommodate calculated risks in terms of support and decisions on support have clearly made a big difference for several of the applicants.\nLast autumn, the results of the user survey were brought into a development project which, among other objectives, aims to optimize and streamline the fund's day-to-day communication with applicants and other stakeholders. In 2022, this project is due to result in the development of a new website for the Nordic Culture Fund meant to facilitate greater public, relevant knowledge of the various parts of the fund's work.   \nProject ambassadors\nThe fund's project ambassadors form an important part of our communication work in relation to our various target groups. These ambassadors help increase the geographical and cross-sector accessibility of the fund. In 2021 the fund had five project ambassadors who all have valuable experience from cultural projects and network-building. They are all active in various sectors of the cultural field.\n\n"

It is not possible to apply for Puls as a new applicant. Already appointed Puls promoters must apply annually to continue as Puls promoter.\nPuls is a springboard for the creation of a Nordic music network which seeks to bring musical experiences of high artistic quality to a wider Nordic public. It is therefore designed as:\n\t\ta funding programme targeted towards concert promoters\n\t\ta network for Puls promoters in the Nordic countries\n\t\twork within cultural policy that collaborates with national funding organizations in all the Nordic countries\nWHY PULS?\nPuls\u00a0is designed to help live music transcend boundaries, including national borders and narrow genre boundaries, to support new bands, up-and-coming talent and new trendsetters, and to act as a counterweight to the purely commercial approach \u2013 which, although important and vital for growth in the music industry, has a tendency to dominate the scene unless new, less immediately commercial music is also supported.\nWHICH GENRES?\nPuls\u00a0is relevant for all kind of music that operates freely in networks of creatives, performers and publicists, and involves both funding bodies and market forces.\u00a0\u00a0The so-called \u2018rhythmic genres\u2019 are ideal for this. There is also freedom of movement between genres, as many stakeholders move between or across multiple genres, including experimental music and sound art.\u00a0Puls\u00a0is based on the\u00a0bottom-up\u00a0principle, so the promoters curate the content.\nSupport\nIn 2017-2021 Puls has allocated approximately DKK 20.5 million to venues and festivals throughout the Nordic region.\u00a0The funding is for promoters as curators, as\u00a0points of contact\u00a0between artists and new audiences.\n\u00a0\nThe Nordic Culture Fund finances the Puls programme. In 2019-2020, Puls was additionally financed by the Nordic Council of Ministers for Culture, the Danish Arts Foundation, the Finnish Music Foundation (MES) and the Ministry of Education and Culture in Finland.\nTHREE INITIATIVES\nSupport for concert promoters\nPuls is a standalone four-year funding programme. Puls provides funding to enable promoters to stage promising artists based in the Nordic Region, and to communicate with audiences in a focused manner. The Nordic concert promoters work on the basis of an artistic idea and an artistically relevant Nordic program.\n\u00a0\nLocal support\nThe Nordic Culture Fund will work with other stakeholders to establish resources that will further underpin\u00a0Puls, e.g. via private foundations or national funding schemes that pursue Nordic objectives.\n\u00a0\nNetwork\nThe Nordic Culture Fund will also work with relevant stakeholders to facilitate improvements to venues and set up networks to debate issues related to live music in the Nordic region, devise joint solutions and arrange events at which audiences encounter Nordic music. This will include network meetings with selected Nordic promoters.\nTHOUGHTS BEHIND PULS\nThe Puls initiative is based on several assessments and discussion on the current challenges and potential in developing the Nordic live music scene. The Nordic market has great but untapped potential for recorded music, live music and jobs.\n\u00a0\nTogether, the countries comprise the 12th largest economy in the world, and have similarities in arts funding, labour-market structures and patterns of consumption.\n\u00a0\nIn an era of digital streaming, live gigs are increasingly essential to a thriving music scene. Live music is a world of unique experiences.\n\u00a0\nThis is where the market is really changing, which makes it paradoxical that Nordic artists rarely perform in other countries in the Region. People have only limited knowledge of music in the neighbouring countries, and artists need an international hit to make a breakthrough that resonates throughout the Region.\n\u00a0\nThe Culture Fund wants to change all that, and the Puls programme has been designed with this purpose in mind.\nEvaluation criteria\n\t\tThe quality of the music programme and of the project\u2019s long-term artistic ambitions and visions\n\t\tQuality of the collaboration with other Puls promoters and possibly external collaboration\n\t\tThe project\u2019s cultural\/artistic, regional and Nordic significance\n\t\tThe applicant\u2019s professional role and music-industry competences.\n\t\tQuality and innovation in communications and audience development.\n\t\tThe applicant's plans for incorporating Puls in their future work."

The agreement is an inter-state contract, and all changes to it must be ratified by each Nordic country.\nThe Nordic Culture Fund is an independent legal person associated with the Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers.\nThe fund is represented and managed by a board, whose 13 members are appointed by the Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers. Each Nordic country is represented by two members, while the Faroe Islands and Greenland and \u00c5land have one representative each.\nIn 2021, the fund had a budget of approx. DKK 36 million. This funding comes from the budget of the Nordic Council of Ministers approved by the Nordic Council. Within the provisions of the agreement, the fund is allowed to receive grants from other parties as funding for its endeavours.\nThe fund's strategy\nThe 2019-2022 strategy of the Nordic Culture Fund was extended with three years in 2021, now running until 2025. \nThe first two years of the strategy have confirmed its relevance for the fund. Based on these experiences, we wanted to sharpen our efforts and make room for a more long-term focus.\nThe fund's strategy work hitherto, including our experiences with the global focus and the reduced priority of the official cultural cooperation, makes it essential for us to clarify and adjust our strategy work. That is why, in the coming period, the fund will strive to establish a wider source of funding and engage in Nordic cultural cooperation in new ways, for example through strategic partnerships.\nWe also extended our strategy in order to emphasize that artistic and cultural cooperation is a crucial key to the future. Especially after an era where the Nordic countries have chosen to solve essential global problems independently. An era where we have been constantly reminded of the connection between the local and the global, the discussion of centre vs. periphery, the new public sphere of the digitalization, changing artistic identities, new audience experiences and not least the lack of affinity and community.\nThe extension of the strategy highlights the importance of its three main objectives, all of which \u2013 in each their own way \u2013 works like catalysts for the development of art, culture and cohesion in the Nordics.\n\n\u2014 \nThe Nordic Culture Fund will promote and facilitate the production, innovation and communication of art and culture in the Nordics and globally.\n\u2014 \nThe Nordic Culture Fund will strengthen artistic and cultural networks at all levels within the framework of Nordic cultural cooperation.\n\u2014 \nThe Nordic Culture Fund will develop and communicate knowledge of the world of art and culture in order to stimulate a dynamic development of cultural policy in the Nordics.\nIn the revised and extended version of the strategy, the fund will continue to work for three main objectives:\nAt the same time, we have updated the interdisciplinary efforts of the strategy to allow us to elaborate further on our experiences from the first period and seek to include more actors in Nordic cultural cooperation. This way we can illustrate the enormous significance of art and culture for our lives and our futures both within and beyond the Nordics.\nThe formerly five interdisciplinary efforts have been revised and there are now only four:\n\u2014 Development of differentiated support \n\u2014 Enhanced global focus\n\u2014 Enhanced network formation\n\u2014 Strengthened knowledge cooperation and new developmental frameworks for cultural policy\n\nImplementing the strategy\nIn the following sections we will specify how, in 2021, the fund was endeavoured to reach its main objectives through the four strategical efforts:\n\u2014 Development of   differentiated support \u2014 Enhanced global focus\n\u2014 Enhanced network formation \u2014 Strengthened knowledge   cooperation and new contexts   for cultural policy development\nDevelopment of differentiated support\nThe fund's strategic efforts on \u201cdifferentiated support\u201d implies that we as a fund are open and able to pick up on new tendencies. This is required if we are to support art and culture characterized by diversity, accessibility and high quality. In concrete terms, our differentiated support is expressed through our various support programmes Project Support, Opstart, Puls, Globus, Globus Opstart and Development Support, all of which have been active in 2021.\nOur user-survey from the spring of 2021 concludes that profiling the fund as a catalyst, along with our differentiated approach to support work, has made a difference for many of the applicants. The survey also shows that the fund's thematical effort, Globus, and its interdisciplinary framework covers a strong need within art and culture in the Nordics. \nBased on our development support we have worked actively and strategically throughout 2021 to establish relevant collaborations that enable the partners, including the fund itself, to monitor the projects for a period gaining unique and relevant insights. Our development support is characterized \u2013 often on an experimental basis \u2013 by delving into themes or set-ups that are relevant to the strategy and to the thematical support programmes of the fund.\nTWO EXAMPLES OF PARTNERSHIPS \nTHROUGH DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT\nStrategic development of cultural institutions\nWith the Bikuben Foundation we have undertaken a pilot-project in 2020 and 2021 where we developed a process whereby we can test the possible realization of the potentials of several art institutions in relation to their positions in the landscape of art and culture, sustainable business models and possible international partnerships.\nThis pilot project has been successful. It has also contributed to a solid basis for strategic development of the individual institution and strengthened international cooperation. It has also led to a decision to continue this cooperation for another two years, in 2022 and 2023.\nNordic talent platform\nIn a partnership with the international platform for artistic cooperation, Art Hub Copenhagen, Talent Norway and a\/ nordi\/c, we will in the coming two years (2022-2023) explore the possibility of a Nordic talent platform. \nThe talent platform builds on the experiences from an earlier collaboration with Talent Norway. The idea is to examine and support the opportunity to establish a common Nordic talent effort to strengthen talent development, both nationally and at a Nordic level."

During autumn 2020 it is also possible to apply for Globus Opstart which supports the development of ideas and collaboration in global contexts.\nWith Globus, we are writing a new chapter in our history\nWe intend to meet artists where they are, support them with trust and with willingness to take risks, thereby making room for global perspectives on our part of the world.\u2028\nThe programme is a response to the ever-growing need for new ways to act informally and progressively across borders. That is why the fund is launching the new global initiative, which will expand perspectives on Nordic art and culture.\nA new way of looking at funding\nUnlike the fund's other programmes such as Puls, Handmade and Opstart, there is no criterion for regional co-operation in the programme. On the contrary, we aim to support projects that cannot be implemented in the Nordic region alone.\n\u00a0\nIn this way, we intend to stimulate projects that use art and creativity as a catalyst for conversations with the younger generations and the new citizens of the Nordic countries; projects that will help to develop the public space, creating new communities that can rise above the languages and differences that separate us, and causing new things to arise in our common democracy\n\nGLOBAL VERSUS INTERNATIONAL\nWe view the global as borderless - the world as a united whole.\nThe international is defined by the borders between nations, so its scale is narrower than the global, as is implied by the word itself: inter-national.\n\u2028Global\u00a0We will create global relevance for the Nordic co-operation.\nInternational\u00a0We will participate in international networks.\nPilot projects\nIn its first year, the new programme will be tested on few selected pilot projects. Here we will obtain concrete project experience which can lead to a more open support programme with diverse approaches.\n\u00a0\nAll of our pilot projects aim to embrace and engage with the younger generation of artists, institutions and cultural performers in order to clarify their voices. In these pilot projects, we will work with a number of different partners both inside and outside the Nordic region, which will help to secure a broader financing basis and a long-term focus.\n\u00a0\nTogether with talent organisations, we will investigate what is required for young, talented artists to realise their dream projects, on the basis of global collaboration.\n\u00a0\nWe will strengthen the conversation about the Nordic region as a centre of arts and culture, and create a new international network for critical thinking that will support Nordic artists and cultural practitioners on the global stage.\n\u00a0\nWe will conduct democratic projects at street level and explore how artistic mobility can be facilitated within the Nordic region, as a developed region, as well as in other places in the world that do not have the same preconditions. Here, together with UNESCO and others, we will strengthen the dialogue on the diversity of cultural expressions and the diverse role of cultural policy in the world. We see this as central to paving the way for global cultural co-operation both within and outside the Nordic region.\n\n\nGlobus Opstart\nWith Globus Opstart, the Nordic Culture Fund is taking the first exploratory step towards establishing Globus as a support program during 2021. We want to investigate how artists and cultural practitioners' global collaboration takes place and can be developed between practitioners from the Nordic countries and the rest of the world.\n\u00a0\nYOUR GLOBUS OPSTART PROJECT\nWe encourage applicants to think new in terms of idea, theme as well as networking and collaboration. And we encourage applicants with the projects to investigate and establish clear structures and project organizations, which can lead to the formation of networks with the global projects, characterized by deep relations and duration.\n\u00a0\nWith Globus Opstart, we also encourage applicants to develop partnerships with \u201cglobal signs\u201d, and we welcome projects that work with both the global south and the global north. The projects can both include physical meeting or be developed using digital platforms and tools.\u2028\nThe projects must be clearly linked to artistic and\/or cultural environments. The Nordic Culture Fund does not fund projects that focus primarily on, for example, sporting events, business development, technological development and innovation, the social area, journalism or social science.\n\n\nWhen assessing applications:\n\t\tSupport from the fund is dependent on binding participation and contributions from artists and cultural practitioners working outside the Nordic region. The project must have a Nordic anchoring but must not be able to be developed in the Nordic region alone.\u2028\n\t\tWe look at how the project thinks new in terms of idea, theme and in relation to the establishment of networks and collaboration.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The goal is unashamedly ambitious: to boost the transformative potential of the arts and culture in societies and communities.\n\nExperiments are met with confidence and a willingness to take risks\nThrough Globus Call, we support artistic and cultural collaborations which in their practice aim to break down traditional barriers and work across cultural, social, historical, geographical or professional boundaries. The programme encourages the building of cross-cutting collaborations and networks that seek new perspectives and develop dialogue across contexts.\nThe programme is open to projects that work with experimental approaches and methods, and which strive to explore interactions between the local and the global. The intention is to meet artists in the contexts and positions in which they find themselves, and to support them with trust and a willingness to take risks.\nThe maximum amount that can be granted is DKK 700,000. Please note that projects at last year\u2019s Call on average were supported with approx. DKK 350,000 DKK.\nThe projects must be rooted in artistic and\/or cultural milieux, but may draw upon other professional fields and traditions.\nRead about previously granted projects\nDropdown icon\nIn the first Globus Call in 2022, the Fund supported 14 projects with a total amount of 4,8 million DKK.\n\nThe Nordic in Globus\nThrough Globus, the Fund wishes to develop a wider and more inclusive understanding of the idea of working Nordically. Here, the Nordic is defined not as a collaboration between nation states, but as an idea or context that is not bound by national borders, and which can be explored through artistic and cultural encounters in and around the world.\nThe projects must have a clear link to and\/or relationship with the Nordic region in terms of partners, themes or activities, but must not solely be capable of being developed within the Nordic countries themselves. Projects that operate exclusively in the Nordic region are not therefore eligible for funding under the programme. Unlike the Fund\u2019s other programmes, Project Funding and Opstart, there is no requirement for co-operation between the Nordic countries.\nPlease note that projects which meet the assessment criteria of the Fund\u2019s other programmes are not generally eligible for Globus funding. This applies, for example, to projects that focus primarily on activities or the development of co-operation within the Nordic region.\nNordic relevance through networking and exchanges\nAs part of Globus, we facilitate a network between those projects that have received funding through the programme. This includes the development of structures and online forums for further knowledge exchange between the partners involved, and between individual projects and the Foundation.\nVia this network, we explore a new form of Nordic relevance in collaboration with the specific projects, rather than focusing exclusively on specific requirements for broad Nordic collaboration in the individual initiatives.\nProjects that receive funding are expected to participate in network meetings and knowledge-sharing sessions during the funding period.\nFunding principles\nProjects will be assessed upon the following principles, which reflect the overall aims of the Globus programme:\nExploring global practice\nUnderstood as the ambition of the project, and means to:\n\t\tdevelop collaborations that transcend bounded categories between countries and disciplines\n\t\taddress themes\/approaches which require long-term development\n\t\torientate towards, or draw from specific local practices and contexts while acknowledging their entanglements with their wider surroundings on a local, regional, global or planetary scale.\nCuriosity towards the unknown\nSeen as the ways in which the project:\n\t\tdemonstrate a tangible idea and vision for the overall project\n\t\tpossess an ambition to observe from alternative positions and points of view\n\t\toperate with exploratory\/research based approaches in their artistic development, to acquire knowledge, build collaborations and nuance the work to changing environments.\nMutual commitment & engagement\nThe aims and means of the applicant to:\n\t\tform strong collaborations and networks based on mutual commitment and engagement among partners\n\t\tdevelop or facilitate clear and sustainable structures and project organizations which enable and depend on the specific qualifications of the involved partners.\nPriority will be given to projects which can demonstrate a concrete aim for long-term effects that go beyond the grant period.\n\n\n\nConditions\nBudget\n\t\tThe maximum amount that can be granted is DKK 700,000. The amount should be matched with a relevant co-financing or other resources to the extent possible. There must be a clear purpose for the project\u2019s use of the funding. Please note that projects at last year\u2019s Call on average were supported with approx. 350,000 DKK.\n\t\tIt is mandatory to attach a budget showing the overall costs and expected income of the project.\u00a0You are welcome to make use of the Fund\u2019s template to create an informative budget.\nProject period\n\t\tThe maximum grant period is two calendar years following the year in which the grant was provided. The grant period is the period during which the activities funded by Nordic Culture Fund are planned to take place. The project\u2019s aims may extend over a longer time frame.\nApplications\n\t\tApplications must be submitted through the Fund\u2019s digital platform My Page during the application period. All applications must be submitted in English. Applications submitted by post or e-mail will not be considered.\nPublicity\n\t\tThe Fund\u2019s grants are published on our website and in our annual report.

        "texts":"\nEnhanced global focus\nFor historical reasons, the global perspective is, in several ways, natural for the Nordic Culture Fund. Shortly after the Second World War, there was momentum for the idea of a Nordic Culture Fund as an autonomous organization with the purpose of working internationally inside and outside the Nordic countries. Today, this is felt in the fund's partnerships and its efforts within the support programme Globus.\nTHE FUND'S GLOBUS EFFORT\nIn 2021, the fund has cooperated with a number of international organizations. We have established a cooperation with IFACCA on inviting actors from the global South to participate in IFACCA's world congress in Stockholm in May\/June 2022. Supported by the fund, the WHO will examine how art and culture can be integrated in the health sector. And our partnership with UNESCO has led to a report published in December 2021 highlighting artistic freedom of expression in a global perspective.\nIn November 2021, based on the fund's concrete experiences with Globus, the board decided that the fund will continue in 2022 and 2023 to develop Globus further within a cohesive, multi-track model where Globus Opstart and the partnership projects as of January 2022 will be supplemented by a new multi-annual form of support. This model is meant to ensure an investigative and interdisciplinary approach with several relevant lines of entry enabling a diversified project-scape.\nThe purpose of Globus is to provide artists and cultural practioners with new ways to work with a Nordic focus on the global issues and to give them a chance to apply for funding, with fewer strictures than before, for projects with a trans-Nordic reach. The intention is to meet the artists where they are and support them with trust and a certain readiness to run risks. With Globus, the fund is re-thinking cultural support, focussing less on narrowly defined categories and affording an alternative to the requirement of having a national affiliation in terms of the assessment of international cultural cooperation.\nEnhanced network formation\nIn 2021, the Nordic Culture Fund has assumed an active role in relation to networks and network formation. This is done by means of the funds support grants, which have always had an element of network formation, but also through the fund's partnerships and its unique role as a proactive driver of and participant in networks.\nThe fund has continued, in 2021, to run the support programme Puls, covering a network of 48 Nordic concert organizers. One of the chief components of the Nordic live music network is an annual network meeting. In November 2021 the participating concert organizers met in Reykjavik where they focussed on restarting the dialogue after long lockdowns and difficult conditions for cooperation across the Nordics because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The meeting succeeded in re-igniting the many strands of collaboration and dialogue that had partly been suspended during the pandemic. This was possible, because the fund since 2018 has worked consciously and in a long-term, curatorial perspective with the relational aspects of the network which makes it easier for the participants to reactivate dialogue and cooperation.\nIn October 2021, the fund facilitated a strategic workshop for the network of Nordic and Baltic Culture Council directors. This meeting showed how important it is to discuss differences and comparability across national borders. The network confirms the need to meet across borders and barriers and to develop a more up-to-date connection between the framework of cultural policy, the various official, but independent support institutions and the artistic environments in the Nordics and the Baltic states.\nStrengthened knowledge cooperation and new contexts for cultural policy development\nThis interdisciplinary strategic effort entails an active role for the fund as a facilitator of knowledge production and policy development \u2013 for example by engaging in partnerships with actors and organizations that may take part in examining, collecting and debating knowledge of the field of art and culture. Along with other organizations, we want to create new frameworks for conversations on cultural policy and for knowledge sharing. In 2021, the fund has met an increased demand for its knowledge and experience in debates, networks, at conferences and in the form of new initiatives.\nIn 2021, the two pivotal elements of this work have been the establishment of the association a\/nordic\/ and the publication of the anthology \u201cReflections \u2013 art culture politics society\u201d.\nTHE ANTHOLOGY \u201cREFLECTIONS \u2013 ART CULTURE POLITICS SOCIETY\u201d\nIn June 2021, the fund launched the anthology \u201cReflections \u2013 art culture politics society\u201d. It came into being as a result of our ambition to expand the scope of people's view of the politics of art and culture and to stimulate the understanding of the societal significance of art and culture.\nThe anthology is meant to function as an inspiring knowledge resource and as a point of departure for further discussions of the development of cultural politics in the Nordics. The book consists of essays and interviews with a number of thinkers, researchers, civil servants and artists, all with extensive backgrounds in different fields in the Nordics and beyond. Among other venues and contexts, the book was presented at the Gothenburg Book Fair in 2021. The idea is for the fund to host network meetings on cultural policy all over the Nordics in 2022 and 2023, with the anthology as a point of departure.\nIn 2021, very much prompted by the anthology, the fund initiated a strategic partnership between the Nordic Culture Fund, a\/ nordi\/c and the Nordic institutions Hanaholmen (Finland), Nordic House Reykjavik, Nordic House Faroe Islands and Nordic House Greenland. These partners will work together to conduct a number of network meetings on cultural policy aiming to put the conditions of art and its relations to cultural policy on the agenda. The purpose of the effort is to create a new kind of dialogue and knowledge sharing across the many different actors in cultural policy and in the fields of art and culture, but also to stimulate an advanced discussion on the development of cultural policy in a local\/regional, national and Nordic perspective.\nA\/NORDI\/C\nIn 2020, the board of the fund decided to launch a process that would lay the fund for a new Nordic partnership project through the course of 2021. This led to the establishment of the association a\/nordi\/c, the first Nordic think tank for art. This think tank works independently of the Nordic Culture Fund and has its own board and management.\nThe fund will continue to support this initiative throughout the establishment phase. Looking ahead, the fund and a\/nordi\/c will also be able to cooperate and collaborate on different projects in the respective roles and perspectives of the two parties.\n"

        "texts":"\n\nPreface\nIn the Nordic Culture Fund, we work to set a direction for the cultural cooperation of the future.\nAlmost 18 months after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the board of the fund decided to extend and adjust the strategy of the fund with three additional years, now running until 2025. In a time where artists and cultural actors continue to navigate within strong uncertainty and where international cultural cooperation in many countries has been forced aside in favour of national priorities and agendas, we have found it important to further clarify the work of the fund. To create a stronger long-term focus and engage in Nordic cultural cooperation in new ways.\nIn the past year, this work has led us in the direction of more partnerships, networks, knowledge-sharing and new ways to support art and culture \u2013 globally and in the Nordics. At the same time, we have strengthened the position of the fund as a proactive partner for institutions of art and culture while stimulating policy development within specific areas.\nThe experiences from this past year have also emphasized the need for new points of departure for the development of Nordic cultural policy. We see a changing role for art and culture in the welfare society, and we have identified a need to rethink some of the institutional premises and concepts that have long served as a self-evident grammar of Nordic cultural policy.\nThis was the background for our publication, in June, of the anthology Reflections \u2013 art culture politics society. In this book we present various voices discussing topics such as the role of art in democracy, the development of art and the financial and institutional framework of culture as well as the crucial role of art and culture in the development of sustainable societies. Our journey with this anthology will continue in the coming years in the form of a number of talks and dialogue meetings on cultural policy where all these topics will be further discussed.\nIn 2021, the fund's longstanding efforts to create new frameworks for cultural policy also led the board to establish a new, independent actor, a\/nordi\/c, which as of 2022 will serve as the very first Nordic-level think tank for art. This organization stems from a partnership initiative launched by the Nordic Culture Fund and aims to stimulate development within Nordic cultural policy and to establish a strong network in which the fund can serve as a crucial stakeholder and interlocutor.\nAfter a long period where the Nordic countries have focussed on sustaining a national life of culture, we have seen the emergence of a need to revitalize the international dimension of cultural policy taking its cue from the transformative and dynamic force of culture itself. With contributions from the Nordic Culture Fund, the Danish UNESCO delegation published a report in December on artistic freedom of expression in light of the COVID-19 epidemic. According to this report the pandemic has increasingly confronted artists, journalists and researchers with restrictions and attempts to control their work. The results underline the \n\nimportance of creating a deeper understanding of artistic freedom and its significance for democratic exchange and innovation in any society.\nEven though art and culture increasingly address global tendencies and problems, the political interest in international cooperation within art and culture is sadly declining \u2013 also within the official Nordic cooperation. The Nordic culture budget is still confronted with drastic cuts in spite of even stronger agreement among artists, cultural actors and parliamentarians across the Nordic countries that reduced culture budgets have a strongly detrimental effect on the Nordics as the world's most sustainable and integrated region. Paradoxically, according to the vision of the Nordic Council of Ministers, sustainability was precisely what the increased funding capacity achieved by the cuts was supposed to help achieve, but it has the exact opposite effect.\nThe fund's Globus initiative will strengthen and support the cross-border nature of art and culture in terms of expression as well as forms of cooperation, accessibility and participation. The ambition to widen the perspective on Nordic art and culture is clear in the sub-programme Globus Opstart which, in 2021 alone, has supported 30 projects with participants from no fewer than 50 different countries. In 2022, the Globus work will continue as a new support programme meant to give artists and cultural actors the freedom to expand their global practices and artistic activities in a changing world.\nIn a year characterised by a high degree of uncertainty, the fund has benefitted from a well-anchored administration and a strategically thinking board. We have rearranged, but not reduced our activities. All decisions \u2013 whether due to emergencies or expected events \u2013 are well-considered and guided by long-term aims. The changes we make in the present, will change the future.\nWe choose to expand and open up by thinking innovatively and freely. We look ahead. How can we, based on limitations, create something bigger? From a Nordic position, we will show that we are a part of a world reaching far beyond our own borders. Physical as well as mental borders.\nWhen we open up the Nordics, the world will open for us. Art and culture is the key.\n"

The Fund's operations are based on a special agreement between the Nordic countries which was signed in 1966 and subsequently amended in 1975 and 1990.\nThe total amount available for distribution as grants from the Fund is set in the Nordic Council of Ministers' budget and is approx. DKK 25 million in 2001.\nThe Cultural Fund's board comprises 11 members: two from each of the Nordic countries appointed for a term of two years by the Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers, plus one member to represent those Nordic areas which are self?governing, i.e. \u00c5land, the Faeroe Islands and Greenland.\n\u00a0\n2. FUND ALLOCATION POLICY\nGeneral\nThe Cultural Fund supports Nordic cultural cooperation projects, the scope of which ranges from general culture and art to education and research. The Fund primarily supports projects in the Nordic countries. Projects between at least three Nordic countries and neighbouring areas (the Baltic states and north?west Russia) and between at least three Nordic countries and the rest of Europe are also eligible for funding.\nEducation and research projects are prioritized on the basis of their links with the world of culture. Such projects might include cultural research, cultural policy research, cultural pedagogy and education in cultural fields.\nThe Fund aims to encourage new groups to work together. We want to promote innovative work forms and methods together with experimental activities. Cross?sectoral projects and sector?wide activities are considered to be important in this context. The Fund attaches importance to quality, Nordic breadth and Nordic added value.\nPrioritized areas include projects for and with children and young people, projects which promote an understanding of the Nordic languages, projects which encourage the use of new media, projects which aim to reduce xenophobia and racism and projects which have mass appeal.\nThe Fund aims to increase the degree of cooperation in the voluntary sector and encourage initiatives from sparsely populated areas and areas on the Nordic periphery (Iceland, Greenland, Faroe Islands, Arctic Region, east Finland and south Denmark).\nThe Fund also aims to promote quality in Nordic art and cultural cooperation. Preference is given to projects which cannot be carried out nationally and which increase Nordic expertise. The following rules govern the Fund's financing to applicants. The Fund can also initiate projects itself in the form of outreach activities.\n\u00a0\nThe Fund can finance:\n\t\u2022\tCooperation projects which, as a rule of thumb, involve at least three Nordic countries. The self?governing areas of Greenland, the Faeroe Islands and \u00c5land are considered to have equal status with the other Nordic countries.\n\t\u2022\tOne-off projects.

The work will provide a flexible framework for developing initiatives that contribute to new knowledge about the arts and culture field and stimulate policy development in specific areas.\n\n\nThe new types of partnership projects build on the Fund\u2019s strategic efforts and experience over many years in networking and cultural policy development at the Nordic level.\n\u201cThere is a growing need for greater exchange of experience and knowledge in the Nordic region when it comes to the development of arts and cultural life. We want to explore how creating relations between different actors and initiatives can strengthen co-operation in the Nordic region and contribute to mutual exchange of knowledge across borders. By taking a more active role as a facilitator and dialogue partner, the Fund can help ensure that initiatives developed at national level can also be taken into a broader Nordic and international context,\u201d\u00a0says Benny Marcel, Director of the Nordic Culture Fund.\nPartners in the projects range from cultural institutions and research centers to major global associations, such as UNESCO and the WHO Regional Office for Europe. Through different themes, such as the intervention of art in health and the role of culture in sustainable development, the Foundation will bring art and culture into new conversations and expand the space for international cultural cooperation.\nIn Denmark, the Nordic Culture Fund has joined forces on concrete initiatives with the research center Art as Forum and the Bikuben Foundation, among others. The latter has resulted in the new \u201cTask Force\u201d program, which aims at strengthening capacity and long-term development of artistic institutions.\nResponding to new needs in the arts and culture field\nThe work on partnerships is part of the Nordic Culture Fund\u2019s current strategy and partly stems from the acute situation triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic in the arts and culture field in spring 2020. The first initiatives were launched as pilot projects that provided an opportunity to test ideas and gather important experience:\n\u201cWe wanted to ensure space for open and experimental development and exploration of approaches. At the same time, we wanted a better insight into the work of the cultural actors, which was of course strongly influenced by the pandemic.\u00a0 Since then, it has become even more apparent that to ensure a sustainable, experimental and free arts and cultural life, we as a foundation need to base our work more on responsiveness, trust and more agile solutions. This is why we are also working actively to ensure that the knowledge we gain through partnerships is used in the further development of our support programs and other initiatives,\u201d\u00a0says Anni Syrj\u00e4l\u00e4inen, Senior Adviser at the Nordic Culture Fund.\nIn several of the projects, the ambition is also to inspire and contribute to the cultural policy conversation and development in the Nordic Region. The aim is often to create a better dialogue and knowledge sharing between policy and the performing arts and cultural field. An example of this is a trans-Nordic partnership with Nordic cultural centers and the think tank a\/nordi\/c, which will result in a series of cultural policy network meetings around the Nordic region during 2022-2023.\nEXAMPLES OF CURRENT PARTNERSHIPS\nExploring culture as a public good to achieve sustainable development and promote human rights \u2013 Working with UNESCOThe Nordic Culture Fund has joined forces with UNESCO to explore the role of culture as a global public good. The work is based on the partners\u2019 respective expertise, experience and networks. The project will be launched at UNESCO\u2019s major world conference Mondiacult \u2013 Cultural Policies for Sustainable Development, to be held in Mexico on 28-30 September 2022. The partnership will result in a major report that will provide a basis for cross-sectoral understanding of the contribution of culture to the sustainable agenda on a global scale.\nArts & Health Collective \u2013 Collaboration with WHO Regional Office for Europe 2021-2023Together with the WHO Regional Office for Europe, the Nordic Culture Fund has launched a pilot project that brings together academics, artists, cultural institutions, health professionals and decision-makers from different countries to explore effective and sustainable strategies to integrate arts and culture broadly into the health sector. The project is part of the Nordic Culture Fund\u2019s Globus initiative, which aims to extend the reach of Nordic cultural co-operation by investing in long-term networks and stronger international ties.\nCommunities of Separatism \u2013 collaboration with Kunsten som ForumIn 2022-2023, Kunsten som Forum and the Nordic Culture Fund will jointly investigate the cultural policy framework for racialized artists and cultural workers in the Nordic countries as part of the research project \u201cCommunities of Separatism\u201d, also supported by the \u201cArts and Social Communities\u201d grant. The project examines how separatist organizing challenges and expands the notion of community, and looks at the interplay between artistic organizing, cultural politics and a changing concept of art in the Nordic region. The research is conveyed in both scientific articles and popular media.\nTaskforce \u2013 Working with the Bikuben Foundation on development programs for cultural institutions\u00a0Together with the Bikuben Foundation, the Nordic Culture Fund has put together a development program for cultural institutions to help them realize their potential. The aim is to create new opportunities and ensure the sustainable development of artistic institutions by, among other things, strengthening the institutions\u2019 insight into and overview of their own business strategy.\nResilient Music Cities \u2013 Torshavn, Nuuk & Anchorage \u2013 Collaboration with Center for Music EcosystemsTogether with the global NGO Center for Music Ecosystems, the Foundation has explored how music ecosystems can help develop sustainable and resilient communities in geographically isolated places in the Nordic and Alaskan regions. The project will result in a comprehensive report and policy toolkit in October 2022.\nInter-Nordic partnership to organise cultural policy networking meetingsIn 2022-2023, the Nordic Culture Fund will work with the Nordic institutions Hanaholmen (Finland), Nordic House in Reykjavik, Nordic House in the Faroe Islands and Nordic Institute in Greenland and a\/nordi\/c to hold a series of cultural policy network meetings.\n\nAbout partnerships\n\nPartnerships are a cross-Nordic action in the Nordic Culture Fund\u2019s strategy for 2019-2025. The projects are developed as closer collaborations with actors and organizations that can help develop and gather knowledge about arts and culture, and focus on themes relevant to the Fund\u2019s strategy and\/or the development of the Fund\u2019s thematic initiatives.In the context of partnerships, the Fund may award strategic development grants which are not within the scope of the Fund\u2019s funding programmes. The selection of projects, e.g. partnerships, to receive development support is based on the Fund\u2019s external dialogue and networking.\n"

        "texts":"\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nThe Nordic region has a population of 27 million people, and covers a geographical area the size of the seventh largest nation in the world. Worldwide, the Nordic region is the twelfth largest economy.  Culture and art form one of the cornerstones of the Region\u2019s extensive co-operation, and art and culture help to give the Nordic region an ever-increasing significance in relation to the rest of the world. This is the area in which the Nordic Culture Fund operates, and it is here we can make a difference. \n\nThe Nordic Culture Fund has been working in the area of cultural co-operation since 1966, on the basis of an agreement signed by the Nordic countries. The Fund is an independent body which was intended from the start be able to act freely and rapidly, without having to be subject to review by national interests. \nA survey of the Nordic Culture Fund shows that we are currently creating value in several areas of Nordic arts and culture.  In particular, the Fund contributes to extending Nordic networks and contacts. Such networks and contacts provide the starting-point for developing new and innovative methods, approaches and activities to enhance the artistic quality of both the supported projects and of Nordic arts and cultural life in general. At the same time, the Fund contributes to increasing the accessibility of art and culture and the international range of artists. However, we have also identified a number of challenges, trends and factors that we should address in our work going forward. Accordingly, in this strategy we have identified three overall objectives and five cross-cutting strategic focus areas that will set the direction for our work in the coming period. \nThe Nordic Culture Fund operates in a well-developed sphere of Nordic art and cultural life. For many years, the Nordic countries have enjoyed an extensive cultural life, characterised by strong commitment from the state, civil society and citizens. However, the Nordic welfare societies have also undergone major changes over the past 30 years, which have meant a change in the role of cultural policy, art and culture in general. Following the economic crisis of the 1970s, there was a shift in the administration of cultural policy in the Nordic countries. As a result, the view of the role of culture in the lives of the inhabitants of the Nordic region has changed, as has the view of human life and society. The human being is now seen as both a part of society and a bearer of its own interests, in which the acquisition of culture becomes a way to develop creativity and live an independent and reflective life. The initiatives of cultural policy administration have also changed the conditions for the practitioners of art and culture. The goal of streamlining and quality-assuring cultural life has created new challenges for cultural leadership, freedom of expression and the risk-taking that is inherent to artistic endeavour.\nIn this light, the Nordic Culture Fund may be regarded as a public player with independent funds, the distribution of which does not derive from directly politically-controlled decisions. This position has become even more important in our own day, and must form the starting-point for the future work of the Fund. Through this strategy, we aim to ensure that culture can be without borders and open to encounters \u2013 so that all Nordic citizens, both new and established, can enjoy the same right to participate in cultural civil society, and so that Nordic relevance can be enhanced and renewed, with a global focus in mind. \n1 State of the Nordic Region 2018, Nordic Council of Ministers\n2 Interessent- og omverdensanalyse Nordic Culture Fund 2018,  Oxford Research\nFacts\nThe activities of the Nordic Culture Fund are governed by an intergovernmental agreement called the \u2018Agreement between Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden on the Nordic Culture Fund\u2019, which was signed in 1966 and most recently amended in 2002. \nUnder the agreement, the sphere of activity of the Fund encompasses Nordic cultural co-operation in its full extent, both within and outside the Nordic region. The agreement is intergovernmental, and any changes to the agreement must be ratified by each Nordic country.\nThe Nordic Culture Fund is an independent legal entity associated with the Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers. \nThe Nordic Culture Fund is bound and managed by a board, whose 13 members are appointed by the Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers. Each Nordic country is represented by two participants, while the Faroe Islands, Greenland and \u00c5land each have one representative. \nThe Fund currently has a budget of approximately DKK 36 million. The grants of the Nordic Culture Fund are financed from the budget of the Nordic Council of Ministers, which is approved by the Nordic Council.  \nAccording to its agreement, the Fund may also receive other funding for its purposes. Most recently, the Fund has received financial support from the Nordic Council of Ministers for Culture, the Ministry of Education and Culture in Finland, the Danish Arts Foundation in Denmark and the Swedish government for a joint Nordic initiative in the field of music.  \nOn an annual basis, the Fund allocates financial support to around 250 cultural projects in and outside the Nordic region. It also supports, creates and participates in the promotion, development and communication of knowledge of art and culture, and simulates the development of cultural policy in the Nordic region. \n\nOverall objectives\nMission\nThe Nordic Culture Fund works to support innovative and dynamic artistic and cultural life in the Nordic Region that is diverse, accessible and of high quality. \nThrough this mission, we wish to stimulate the development of art and culture at all levels in the Nordic region, as well as in a global context. A qualitatively well-functioning arts and culture milieu helps to develop the creative communities and environments that characterise the Nordic region. This is the foundation for ensuring that art and culture can be free and open to new encounters, new players and new  discoveries. \n\n\n\n\n"

It is not a condition that you must live in the Nordic countries or have a Nordic nationality to apply, but the project must be relevant to our Nordic latitudes.

The Fund does not finance:\n\u00a0\n\t\tBilateral collaborations that do not have a broader Nordic content or target group.\n\t\tProjects that lie outside the artistic or cultural field, such as sports events.\n\t\tProjects that focus primarily on, for example, business development, technological development, the social area, journalism or social science.\n\t\tThe production and publication of products, if this is the sole or primary purpose of the project. This includes, for example, music releases, film and TV production, computer games production, web solutions, book publishing and translations.\n\t\tTouring activities and travelling exhibitions, unless these are part of another substantial Nordic co-operation.\n\t\tStudy, research or school trips, study tours or education.\n\t\tThe participation of individuals or groups in events. Only the planners\/organisers of such events may seek support for this.\n\t\tOperating costs, construction and the procurement of technical equipment for operational use.\n\t\tProjects that are already completed.\n\n\nAssessment criteria\nIn the assessment of applications, the following criteria are emphasised:\nQUALITY OF THE PROJECT\nThe quality of the project is assessed by the Fund on the basis of, for example:\n\t\tThe project\u2019s artistic or cultural ambitions and content.\n\t\tThe project\u2019s method and implementation plan.\n\t\tThe project\u2019s degree of innovation and development, possibly in relation to previous projects.\n\t\tThe general and local interest in the project and its value for the participants.\n\t\tHow the project thinks beyond a national perspective and motivates openness and tolerance.\n\nNORDIC RELEVANCE\nThe Fund assesses Nordic relevance on the basis of, for example:\n\t\tHow the Nordic countries or Nordicness are included in the project.\n\t\tThe degree to which the project is created and implemented by relevant players anchored in various locations in the Nordic countries, and possibly outside the Nordic region.\n\t\tThe substance of the collaboration: the roles of partners and their involvement in the project.\n\t\tHow the project promotes art and cultural life locally, in the Nordic countries, and possibly outside the Nordic region.\n\t\tHow the project promotes exchange and interaction among artists and cultural players.\n\n\nFINANCES\nGrant funding level\nThe maximum grant is DKK 500,000. However, before submitting your application, we recommend that you look at previous grants to get a sense of the typical amounts. See more under All grants.\n\u00a0\nCo-financing\nOne of the Nordic Culture Fund\u2019s funding requirements is that projects must have an appropriate level of co-financing. We consider this to be a key aspect of a project\u2019s anchoring with our partners. Details of funding from other sources also help us build up an overall picture of the project. The larger the amount applied for from the Culture Fund, the higher the expectation is that a project has other funding. In practice, this generally means that a project must be at least 50% co-financed.\n\u00a0\nThe project budget may also include other funding from official Nordic co-operation bodies (e.g. Nordic Culture Point). However, the total amount applied for from these sources must not exceed 85% of the total project budget.\n\u00a0\nThe co-financing may also include payment in kind, in the form of voluntary working hours and other resources. You must stipulate any payment in kind as self-financing in the budget.\n\u00a0\nBudget requirements\nAn informative budget gives the Culture Fund insight into the nature and content of the project and forms part of our assessment of its quality and Nordic relevance. We recommend that you make use of the Fund\u2019s budget and accounting template to generate an informative budget. The headings used on the funding application form summarise the budget.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It all happens from 20th to 29th of May.\nn total, the Fund distributed 2.889 million DKK during its first decision round this year. Because all the successful projects involve a cooperation between 3 Nordic countries, as either organisors, participants, or subject matter, the Fund\u2019s financial backing has enabled at least 150 Nordic people, groups, or organisations to come together and create culture for the inhabitants of the Nordic Region.\u00a0 \u2028More details about the projects can be found on the Fund\u2019s homepage under successful grants.\nThe Nordic-Baltic Cultural Mobility Programme continues\nThe Nordic and Baltic ministers of culture met in Turku on 4 April.

The Gallery seeks a direct confrontation with Greenland\u2019s dramatic nature and topography. This, at least, is the vision of the much-acclaimed Danish architect Bjarke Ingels, winner of the competition to design Greenland\u2019s new National Art Gallery. \u2028This project deserves all the support it can get, declares Karen Bue, Director of the Nordic Culture Fund, who has granted half a million DKK to the architectural competition.\nFor the first time we bring you Satellit \u2013 a new Nordic dance festival for young audiences. In March 2011 children, families, schools, pre-schools, people with a general interest in dance and all of those active in this field are invited to experience a wide range of performances at various venues in and around the city of Gothenburg. Satellit presents eight different dance groups from three Nordic countries making a total of 60 performances. In addition to this there will also be seminars with a Nordic focus.\nSatellit takes place on March 17th-20th in Gothenburg. During the weeks leading up to the festival as well as after, several of the groups visiting Satellit will be touring Gothenburg, V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland and Halland. In other words, dance for young audiences will characterize this whole region throughout the month of March!\nWhat role do the Nordic public service companies play in today\u2019s cultural communication? This was one of many questions addressed at the Public Service at a Cross-road conference, which gathered more than 100 participants on February 10.-11. 2011. \u2028- They play a cricial role. They are the only ones capable of spreading this type, and indeed this quantity, of culture. The cultural obligation is strongly emphasized in the guidelines of these companies, states Kerstin Brunnberg, President of the National Arts Council in Sweden, board member of the Nordic Culture Fund, and active member of SR for the past several years.\n\n\n\n\nFrom Pippi to Kasim\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0The applications received by the Nordic Culture Fund reflect that the Nordic societies of today include many citizens with other cultural backgrounds than the traditional Nordic. This, however, has not always been the case. At the conference \"The Art of Scene Changing\" , director Karen Bue explains how the Fund has actively attracted applicants amongst New Scandinavians\nThe Nordic Culture Fund actively works to attract and include New Scandinavians as applicants. The effort pays off - the number of intercultural applications has raised the past years.In 2010 the Fund received 55 applications from New Scandinavians. \u2028\u2028\u2028\u201dThe applications must reflect the\u00a0diversity of the population\u00a0of \u00a0the Nordic countries and the Fund attained this goal in 2010.

        "texts":"\n\nInitiatives\nAs a cross-cutting strategic initiative, the Fund is working to develop differentiated grants allocations in more holistically-oriented processes, both internally and externally. This means that we work in the following developmental tracks: \n\u2022 We are working for applications in the interim to be processed in a uniform and well-developed application system which provides better possibilities for creating an integral whole and gaining knowledge of the supported projects. \n\u2022 We are developing our support programmes with a longterm dimension in mind, so that the grants can improve the possibility of creating networks that will provide a foundation for increased quality and innovation. \n\u2022 We are working to develop our following-up on the support provided, to allow more knowledge of artistic and cultural life to be collected, thereby ensuring a relevant approach to funding opportunities and a balance in relation to the development of targeted thematic initiatives.\nEnhanced global focus\nWhat do we see?\nThe starting-point for many approaches and initiatives under the agenda of \u201cinternationalisation\u201d argues for the relevance of seeing oneself in relation to the world, and the world in relation to oneself. Many countries simultaneously act with \n\ncontradictory demands for a national focus and a competitive strategy in relation to the rest of the world. But the world is becoming ever more borderless, in a time of dissolution, when the models that were previously characteristic of international efforts are no longer quite so relevant. The public diplomacy efforts of the foreign service and national branding seem to be undermined in the new world order and with the changes that are taking place. Countries and regions are no longer the bearers of their own narratives \u2013 and we are influenced by the challenges of other countries in a new way. \nFor these reasons, it is important that we can help at all levels to contribute to global efforts. The UN\u2019s global goal of sustainable development is becoming increasingly relevant to arts and culture, and demands, for example, increased accountability, less inequality, and the promotion of quality at all levels. At the same time, artistic and cultural life in the Nordic region has an opportunity to take the lead in the development of deep and long-term networks which are distinguished by being borderless and global. There are already many Nordic players in global contexts who are able to interact with each other and can help to create a new form of global relevance for Nordic co-operation. Here, the Nordic Culture Fund could take on a new role in supporting this development. \nInitiatives\nWe will contribute to the development of a new global focus that is relevant to art and cultural life in the Nordic region. The Fund will work to develop new formats and relevant forms of support, criteria and initiatives that do not take place under the auspices of other international efforts. These cross-cutting strategic efforts must be characterised by the following: \n\u2022 We will explore new tracks and arenas for artists and culture practitioners in a global context, and we will collaborate with resource persons who can contribute knowledge of relevant artistic and cultural arenas in key international art and culture environments. \n\u2022 We will experiment with new formats and create artist platforms as well as facilitating deep and sustainable networks that can have global relevance. \n\u2022 We will participate in global networks that discuss the development of art and culture.  \nStrengthened network formation\nWhat do we see?\nThe role of the Nordic Culture Fund in relation to network formation is becoming ever clearer. This takes place both through the Fund\u2019s financial support, which always incorporates an element of networking in itself, and by virtue of the unique role that the Fund has as a proactive driver of and participant in networks. Social networking has seriously gained ground as a concept in sociology, where it denotes a network of relationships between \n\npeople. These can be linked through strong or weak bonds, depending on the degree of knowledge, accessibility, confidentiality and support between the persons involved. \nWe are all linked to each other through many different social networks, such as families, friends and work networks. Relations in professional networks are often based on organisations that have specialised themselves in relation to each other, or work in the same field, as is the case with the Fund\u2019s thematic initiatives. Such networks may be seen as a means of organisation that breaks with both old market forms and with the usual hierarchically-structured organisational forms. \nThe value of networks is enormous. Relations here grow exponentially, and strong networks create the possibility of relating to other networks in other contexts \u2013 including globally. \nIn recent years the Fund has accumulated valuable experience in this area, and we have encountered a wish for this \n\nexperience to be brought into play in more areas. There is also a demand for a player who can bring together the national artistic and cultural institutions across the Nordic region and ensure that they meet and exchange knowledge and experience. This applies inter alia to national public institutions and philanthropic funds that do not have the networks or sufficient knowledge to enable them to lift their programmes and the projects they support to a Nordic and international level. Strengthening these networks will increase the mutual relevance and impact of everyone\u2019s efforts and work.\nInitiatives \nIn accordance with its overall objectives, the Nordic Culture Fund must participate in and facilitate professional networks on several levels. We must utilise the unique knowledge and experience that we thereby acquire to strengthen the further anchoring of the networks in art and culture. The cross-cutting strategic efforts imply that: \n\u2022 We must play a clearer co-ordinating and unifying role for relevant national arts and cultural institutions in the Nordic region. \n\u2022 We must explore the possibilities of working with private and philanthropic arts and cultural funds in the Nordic countries, so that they can lift their programmes onto a Nordic, international level. \n\u2022 We must create frameworks for strong and long-term networks in connection with thematic initiatives, enabling players to promote the quality and sustainability of their own efforts. \n\n\n"

In a time of upheaval, when nations draw in to themselves, art and culture can act as a focal point that opens up, creates links and offers new perspectives \u2013 both towards ourselves and towards the world we live in. With our funding programmes, partnerships and cultural policy work, we therefore aim to bring arts and culture into new forms of dialogue, and provide a flexible frameworks for developing new collaborations and initiatives.\n\nStrategy 2019-2025\nWe emphasise artistic and cultural co-operation as an essential key to the future. The aim of our strategy is therefore to engage even more actors in cultural co-operation, both in the Nordic region and globally.\nThe strategy has three overall goals:\n\t\tWe wish to promote production, innovation and communication in art and culture in the Nordic region and globally.\n\t\tWe wish to promote artistic and cultural networks at all levels of Nordic cultural co-operation.\n\t\tWe wish to develop and disseminate knowledge of the arts and cultural life, with a view to stimulating the development of cultural policy in the Nordic region.\nWe catch trends while they are still new\nSince its inception in 1966, the Fund\u2019s main mission has been to grant financial support. Like few others, we have experienced the continuous motion of cultural life, and we know that no two applications are the same.\nWe currently offer the funding programmes Opstart, Project Funding, Globus Opstart and Globus Call. We are constantly learning more about artistic and cultural life, and the possibilities for practitioners to apply for support. In this way, we ensure that our support is both relevant and targeted.\nAs a Fund, we are willing to take risks and often support the inception and development phases of new artistic and cultural initiatives and networks. Through our various programmes, we currently provide annual support to around 340 cultural projects that build on and develop international and Nordic co-operation.\n\nFacilitator of new networks and knowledge\nAs a Nordic organisation, we are anchored in both the political system and in the field of performing arts and culture. We therefore have the opportunity to take an active role in facilitating new networks and acting as a link between different actors.\nFor several years now, we have also worked to create new contexts for the development of cultural policy at Nordic level. We recognise that the role of art and culture in the welfare society has changed and that there is a need to rethink some of the institutional premises and concepts that have long functioned as the self-evident grammar of cultural policy in the Nordic countries.\nWhen, for example, we enter into partnerships across the boundaries of disciplines, interests and national borders, it is all about making visible, developing and disseminating knowledge of arts and culture so that more people can see and understand the vital role that the arts play in our society.\n\nThe voice of the Nordic region on a global stage\nOur global perspective is not new. The Fund was established as an autonomous organisation shortly after the Second World War, with the aim of working internationally in the Nordic region and beyond.\nOne of the greatest strengths of art and culture is its limitless potential. We believe that art and culture are capable of taking the lead in building international and global networks that can help us to understand and develop our societies. Through our thematic initiative Globus and our collaborations with global actors, we wish to go beyond the national arena and look at artistic and cultural milieux that are created both locally and globally at the same time.\n\nPart of the Nordic co-operation since 1966\nThe Nordic Culture Fund has been working with cultural co-operation since 1966, based on an agreement between the Nordic countries: Denmark, Finland, the Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and \u00c5land. The Nordic Culture Fund is an independent legal entity associated with the Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers.\n\nAs part of the 2019-2025 strategy, we have joined forces with a number of actors and organisations on development projects and initiatives that can contribute to new knowledge about the arts and culture field and stimulate policy development in various areas.\n"

The reason behind the investigation was the general opinion that language comprehension has deteriorated over the past 30 years, when a similar investigation was carried out.\n\u00a0\nDuring this period of time, the Nordic countries have undergone great changes.

Common to all activities of the Fund in the coming period is that it they will support one or more of these three overall objectives\nThe Nordic Culture Fund will promote the production, innovation and communication of arts and culture in the Nordic region and globally.\nThe Nordic Culture Fund must work on the basis of knowledge-based administration of its grants allocations. The grants must help to improve the possibilities for artists and cultural players to jointly create quality, and thereby produce and communicate art and cultural expressions with Nordic relevance, in both Nordic and global contexts. In its grant allocations, the Fund will support risk-taking, networking and knowledge development. As a general rule, the Fund will not provide support for the basic financing of companies. \nThe Nordic Culture Fund will promote artistic and cultural networks at all levels within the Nordic cultural co-operation.  \nNetworking, knowledge-sharing and mutual inspiration are essential to ensure that the work of the Fund is anchored in art and culture in the Nordic region, and that the Fund continues to have a legitimate role in Nordic cultural co-operation. Besides supporting the formation of long-term relations through financial support, the Fund will work proactively to promote and participate in networks, e.g. in specific sectors and at regional, national and international level. \nThe Nordic Culture Fund will develop and communicate knowledge of arts and cultural life in order to stimulate the development of cultural policy in the Nordic region. \nThe Nordic Culture Fund is uniquely positioned to play a role as an active disseminator of knowledge, creating new possibilities and structures in order to collect and convey knowledge of art and culture. The Fund will thereby stimulate the development of cultural policy discussions in order to support and influence the opportunities for arts and culture to develop and form a significant, legitimate and contemporary part of society in the Nordic region and the rest of the world. \n\nCross-cutting strategic initiatives\nOn the basis of the overall objectives, we have formulated five cross-cutting strategic initiatives, each of which supports the overall objectives, thereby setting the direction for the Fund\u2019s work in the coming period. \nThe five strategic initiatives reflect development potentials and challenges that the Fund\u2019s secretariat, experts and board have analysed and discussed with resource persons in separate strategic networks. At the same time, they are an expression of efforts in areas where we can see that the Fund can continue its development and make a difference. Although they exert a mutual influence on each other, the five strategic focus areas are presented separately in the following sections. \n\nDeveloped differentiated grant allocation\nWhat do we see?\nThe ambition to support arts and culture that is characterised by diversity, accessibility and high quality requires a differentiated grant allocation practice that is open and able to capture new trends. This has been developed by the Fund in recent years through the OPSTART, HANDMADE and puls support programmes, with new criteria for all project support. This has allowed us to reach entirely new target groups and facilitate the building up of new, strong relations and forms of co-operation. \nHowever, the development of differentiated grant allocation also requires the development of an overall view. It is no longer merely a question of considering applications for individual projects, but about developing networks and relations in a long-term perspective. It takes time to build up lasting relations, and sometimes there is also a need to try out different collaborative constellations before the applicants can find out what works and who they work well with. \nIn the coming period, the Fund\u2019s grant allocations will therefore provide opportunities for project support on the basis of a broader overall view and a longer time perspective. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Your project must help challenge and break down traditional boundaries for handmade arts, crafts and design. It is therefore a good idea to include individuals or organisations from other disciplines and artistic genres, such as architecture or the visual arts.\nAll applications are reviewed by a special expert group.\u2028The Board of the Nordic Culture Fund makes the final decision on project funding for HANDMADE. The Fund has earmarked DKK 3 million for up to six HANDMADE projects.\n\u2028"

This allows the Fund to engage in work to develop cultural policy and stimulate wide-ranging dialogue about it, particularly on the development of the arts and culture in the Nordic Region.\nRecent priority themes (Children and Young People, DIGITAL and HANDMADE) are examples of the Fund\u2019s approach to cultural policy, which has focused on identifying areas in need of development and providing them with a financial boost.\nIn 2015, the Fund also initiated co-operation with national funding bodies, the Swedish Culture Committee, the Polar Music Prize and the Nordic Council. These new partnerships are expected to continue over the next few years and culminate in joint initiatives, such as a Nordic meeting of national culture committees and a new network for organisers of music events in the Region.\nThe Fund aims to continue to provide a forum for promoting, developing and disseminating knowledge about culture and cultural policy, both through its own follow-up work and through working with relevant partners.\u00a0 The Fund aims to identify relevant and topical policy themes and to facilitate meetings between relevant stakeholders to discuss and develop them. It also aims to participate in existing networks and in the development of themes and debates about freedom of expression, the labour market, etc., which will lead to new initiatives and partnerships.\n\n\nEvery two years, the Nordic Culture Fund awards an extraordinary funding of up DKK 3 million to Nordic projects which address a particular main theme\nThe priority themes are:\nDIGITAL 2015-2016\u2028The Fund wanted to identify a Nordic art and cultural project that interacts with and is communicated by means of new technology and digital media.\u00a0The Fund granted DKK 3 million for this initiative in 2014.\u00a0\nHANDMADE\u2028The idea behind HANDMADE is to stimulate handmade design by encouraging new partnerships at both Nordic and international level. It also seeks to increase visibility by presenting a wide range of innovative handmade arts and crafts, idioms and forms. The Fund has earmarked DKK 3 million for this priority theme.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In a time of upheaval, when nations close in upon themselves, art can act as a focal point that opens up and creates connections.\nWe have three overall objectives:\n\t\tWe will promote the production, innovation and communication of arts and culture in the Nordic region and globally.\n\t\tWe will promote artistic and cultural networks at all levels within the Nordic cultural co-operation.\n\t\tWe will develop and communicate knowledge of arts and cultural life in order to stimulate the development of cultural policy in the Nordic region.\nPART OF THE NORDIC CO-OPERATION\nThe Nordic Culture Fund contributes to positive artistic and cultural development in the Nordic Region by promoting co-operation between Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, the Faroe Islands, Greenland and \u00c5land.\u00a0We do this by gathering knowledge and information, building networks and providing financial support.\n\u00a0\nThe Fund was established in 1966, based on an agreement between all of the Nordic countries.\u00a0The Nordic Culture Fund is an independent legal entity associated with the Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers.\nPrinciples for grant making\nThe Nordic Culture Fund has been working in the area of cultural co-operation since 1966, focusing on the allocation of grants as the main task. Last three years, we have developed a clear and more specified approach for the grants.\n\u00a0\nWe see that cultural life changes continuously and, therefore, there is not two similar application. To meet the different needs of applicants, we have developed more customised grants.\n\u00a0\nCultural life is in continuous movement, and no two applicants are identical. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve developed Opstart, Handmade and Puls. In this way, we can celebrate and support diversity and seize trends while they are still new.\n\u00a0\nThe following principles characterise the grants by the Nordic Culture Fund:\n\n\nDEVELOPMENT OF NORDIC RELEVANCE, QUALITY AND CO-OPERATION\nEvery granted initiative and project need to support at least one of the Fund's criteria:\n\u00a0\nNordic relevance\nThe projects and initiatives are, either partly or fully, created and implemented by stakeholders with a Nordic base. The projects extend beyond a national perspective and promote openness and tolerance.\n\u00a0\nQuality of the projects and how they develop art and culture in the Nordic region\nThe projects and initiatives need to reflect their Nordic relevance and mutual significance in local, regional, national and\/or global contexts. The projects need to have\u00a0long-term artistic or cultural ambitions and visions.\n\u00a0\nQuality and substance of the co-operation\nThere have to be a commitment of participating partners, the target groups, and the extent to which the project is embedded in relevant environments.\n\n\n\nRISK-TAKING\nThe Nordic Culture Fund supports unique projects where the Fund's support has a distinct relevance.\n\u00a0\nThe Fund supports risk-taking and\u00a0through its assesment and grants allocation\u00a0functions as a quality stamp for projects and initiatives.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nCO-FUNDING\nThe Project Funding and the thematic programs must have an appropriate level of co-funding. This is a central part of anchoring the projects to its co-operative partners.\n\u00a0\nThe Fund can support the development of smaller project ideas and the start-up phase of Nordic collaborations without requirements of co-funding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "texts":"\nStrengthened knowledge dissemination\nWhat do we see?\nThe role of art and culture has changed in the welfare society, and there are discussions in many contexts concerning how this role may be viewed from a modern welfare society point of view. In the past, the role of arts and culture was both to create equal conditions for citizens and to provide consumer goods from which we, as citizens, could benefit to a greater or lesser extent. Today, research is moving in the direction of investigating what actually happens in the encounter between arts, culture and civil society, examining not only effects, but also the communities that arise in relation to arts and culture. It is important that we all gain new knowledge of this area, in order to learn more about the democratic infrastructure and freedom of expression represented by arts and culture. The Fund regards it as important for these discussions and this research to be monitored and developed, so that they can become real knowledge at Nordic level. \nThe Fund\u2019s contact with many experts in the sector and researchers in arts and culture, together with cultural policy experts and politicians, gives us a unique opportunity to produce and disseminate qualitative and relevant knowledge about the field of arts and culture. However, capturing these new currents will also require changed structures and resources. One challenge is that there is a large amount of silent knowledge and implicit structures within the field. It is therefore important that we try to collect and make explicit this knowledge across national borders, thereby creating greater benefit and inspiration for others.\nInitiatives\nAs a cross-cutting strategic initiative, we will take on a role as an active communicator of knowledge and create new possibilities and structures to collect and convey knowledge about the field of arts and culture. The initiative implies that: \n\u2022 We must monitor and investigate the possibilities to follow or support relevant research in the field of arts and culture which can contribute to the creation of new knowledge across national borders. \n\u2022 Our knowledge of networks and conversations with resource persons from the cultural field must be developed, concretised and disseminated to relevant partners in the arts and cultural field, as well as in relevant public and cultural policy contexts. \n\u2022 We must develop the following-up of grant allocations and conduct specific analyses, so that we can to a greater extent share knowledge and experience\nNew contexts for  cultural policy development\nWhat do we see?\nThe Fund\u2019s strategic efforts as an active producer of knowledge provide an opportunity to create new contexts for the development of cultural policy at Nordic level. In its organisation, the Nordic Culture Fund is anchored in politics and in the implementation of this, which makes the Fund a unique body in the context of Nordic co-operation and cultural policy. Cultural policy should here be understood in a broad sense, as a way of shaping the function of arts and culture in society. \nThe changing conditions of culture and society emphasise the need for cultural policy to constantly act on an informed basis, and to engage in contexts that go beyond national borders. \nIn recent years, the Fund has evolved into an active co-creator of arenas that create new contexts for cultural policy. In this way, we have stimulated the development of cultural policy discussions at regional, national and Nordic level. We have also worked to create better national and Nordic anchoring for the strategic thematic initiatives. This has also revealed to us the need to understand national administrative initiatives, support schemes and cross-border cultural policy priorities. This knowledge is a prerequisite for raising cultural policy onto the international level, of which the Nordic countries are a part.\nThe Fund has for example identified leadership in the cultural sector as an area which is under ever-increasing pressure. Special demands are placed on the management of creative employees in an organisation, in which the quality of the artistic product is usually the most important goal. Today, we see increased demands for private financing, audience development, innovation, goal achievement and digitisation. \nFor the Fund, it is also a question of how we at the Nordic level can create more knowledge about and synergy between cultural policy, cultural leadership and practice in arts and culture.\nInitiatives\nThe Fund must create new contexts for conversations and knowledge-sharing, and anchor its efforts at either national or Nordic level. These cross-cutting efforts mean that during the interim: \n\u2022 We will strengthen our co-operation with national authorities for cultural support, and create better opportunities for Nordic cultural co-operation to be seen as an integral part of international cultural co-operation. \n\u2022 We will create arenas that can generate new contexts for cultural policy and cultural leadership in the Nordic region. \n\u2022 We will strengthen the dialogue between diverse players in the area of cultural policy and cultural life, and anchor the work in a Nordic context in co-operation with the Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
